The purpose here is to introduce certain general principles that all constitutive models must obey. We will revisit many of the notions presented here later on, in the context of hyperelasticity . Need for constitutive modeling The discussion of continuum mechanics so far has been general enough to accomodate any kind of continuum body. How do we bring about material specificity in our study of continuum mechanics? To understand this better, suppose that we have a cylindrical block of material that we pull at both ends with a known force. It is intuitively clear that the response of the cylindrical block will be very different depending on whether it is made of steel or rubbber. However, the kinematical description of the process and the application of the various balance principles remain the same. So how do we add material-specific information to our theory? This is precisely what constitutive modeling is all about. Let us now look at the same problem from a purely mathematical viewpoint. To keep the discussion simple, let us focus on the case when there is no heat exchange between the body and its environment, and there are no internal sources of heat. Remark Though we are considering the simple case here where there is no internal or external heat transfer, the conclusions we draw can be extended with suitable modifications to the case when they are present. Indeed, we will look into thermoelastic constitutive models later on, in the context of thermoelasticity . In this simple case, we only need to care about the balance of mass, linear momentum and angular momentum: \\begin{split} \\text{Mass: } & \\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = 0,\\\\ \\text{Linear momentum: }& \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\frac{D \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\text{div }\\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t),\\\\ \\text{Angular momentum: }& \\sigma = \\sigma^T. \\end{split} The equations listed above represent a set of 7 distinct equations: one for the mass density, three for the velocity, and three for the stress tensor. Remark Note that though the stress tensor has nine components, there are only three distinct equations that provide us with non-trivial information. To see this, let us suppose we are working within a Cartesian coordinate setting. Then, the three distinct equations are: \\sigma_{12} = \\sigma_{21} , \\sigma_{13} = \\sigma_{31} and \\sigma_{23} = \\sigma_{32} . Notice that the diagonal equations \\sigma_{ii} = \\sigma_{ii} , where i = 1,2,3 do not contribute any new information. There are only three off-diagonal equations since the equation \\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji} is identical to \\sigma_{ji} = \\sigma_{ij} . We however have 13 unknown quantities: one for the scalar mass density, three for the spatial velocity, and nine for the Cauchy stress tensor. We thus need 6 more equations for closure . Equivalently, we can eliminate the equation \\sigma = \\sigma^T by considering only symmetric stress tensors. In this case, we have 6 unknowns for the stress tensor, 3 unknowns for the velocity, and 1 unknown for the mass density; this sums up to 10 unknown fields. The number of equations available reduce to 4: one for the mass density, and three for the velocity. We still need 6 equations for closure, as before. Constitutive models fill in this gap by providing a material specific set of additional equations that allow us to solve the balance principles, once we have the appropriate initial and boundary conditions. How do we specify these six additional equations? What we control are the externally applied body forces and surface tractions. We saw earlier that the continuum responds to this by developing internal forces , namely stresses. It is clear that what differentiates one material from another is the nature of this internal response. In other words, we can, as a first attempt at a constitutive model, think of a general relation of the form \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\rho, \\mathsf{F}, \\mathsf{v}, \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}, \\mathsf{x}, t). For now, the only restriction we have is that \\hat{\\sigma} should yield a symmetric tensor, so that we have 6 additional equations that close the equations supplied by the balance principles. An equation of this form is called a constitutive model , or a constitutive relation . Different materials behave differently; this is captured by the various choices we have in formulating a constitutive model. Thus, as mentioned before, constitutive models bring in material specificity to the balance principles. Note that the balance principles themselves are universal in the sense that they are applicable for any kind of continuum object. An important point to keep in mind is that unlike balance principles, constitutive relations cannot be derived from purely thermodynamic considerations alone. This is because of the fact that thermodynamics, by its very nature, is the study of complex systems without any consideration of their internal constitution. It is thus outside the purview of thermodynamics to deduce facts about the internal response of the system of interest. From the viewpoint of continuum mechanics, a constitutive relation can be thought of as an additional postulate. In practice, tehre are two marjor sources to obtain constitutive relations - the first is, of course, by fitting experimental data with model certain mathematical models, and the second is to deduce the constitutive behavior from a detailed microscopic consideration of the system. In this course, we will adopt the view that constitutive relations are provided to us for various kinds of materials. Remark The companion course AE 731: Multiscale modeling of materials will contain some discussion of how microscopic constitutive behavior emerges starting from a detailed microscopic analysis of certain classes of solids. Restrictions on the form of constitutive relations Desptite the fact that thermodynamics cannot help us formulate the constitutive law associated with a given material, there are very general principles that place restrictions on the form of any constitutive relation we may use. We will now see some of the more important of these constraints. Principle of causality The first constraint that we will impose on constitutive behavior is that the the response of a material at a given instant of time cannot depend on what happens at a future instant of time. This obvious constraint is called the principle of causality , or the principle of determinism . Remark Note however that it is perfectly admissible for the response of a continuum at the current instant of time can depend on its entire history. We will, however, only consider constitutive relations whose response at a given time instant depend only on the values of the variousl field variables at the same instant. Principle of homogeneity A constitutive relation is said to be spatially homogeneous if the material response is the same at every point of the continuum. The simplest way to understand this is by resorting to the ball spring analogy provided earlier. The principle of homogeneity can be roughly translated as the view that the value of spring constant of a spring in a particular region of the body is the same as the value of the spring constant of another spring in a different location. In other words, we assume that the same material is present throughout the continuum. Remark It is possible to study to study continua that are spatially heterogeneous too. In fact, there is an important sub-branch of solid mechanics called mircromechanics where the absence of material homogeneity plays an important role. We will, however, not deal with spatially inhomogeneous continua in this course. We will also assume that the material response of continua is homogeneous in time . This means that the material behavior does not evolve with time. Using the spring mass analogy, this simply means that the spring constants do not change with time. It is important to note that neither spatial homogeneity nor homogeneity in time imply that the continuum does not have spatial gradients in the various physical fields, or that these fields do not evolve with respect to time. The principle of homogeneity simply states that the constitutive behavior does not depend on space and time explicitly. Thus, in place of an equation like \\sigma = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\Xi, \\mathsf{x},t), the principle of homogeneity requires that \\sigma = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\Xi). Here \\Xi could represent one or more of the many kinematic fields. We will see some concrete examples shortly. Principle of local action The principle of local action states that material response at a given point in the continuum depends only on the values of the field variables at that point . For instance, suppose that we have a constitutive relation of the form \\sigma = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\Xi), where \\Xi is some field variable, say the rate of deformation tensor. In general, what this means is that for \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\Xi(\\mathsf{x}',t;\\mathsf{x})), for any \\mathsf{x}' \\in B_{t} . In other words, the response at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t at time t could depend on the response at a different point \\mathsf{x}' \\in B_{t} . The principle of local action restricts the constitutive relations to be of the form \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\Xi(\\mathsf{x},t)). Such constitutive models are said to be local . Remark There are many important classes of materials where the constitutive behavior is non-local . It is possible to extend the laws of continuum mechanics for such materials, but we will not be studying them in this course. Example An example of the form that a constitutive model obeying the priniciples of causality, homogeneity and locality has is given, for example, by \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t),\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t),\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)), where \\mathsf{X} = \\phi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) \\in B_0 . Another example could be a relation of the form \\dot{\\sigma}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathcal{G}(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)). Recall that \\dot{\\sigma} denotes the material time derivative of the Cauchy stress tensor. Principle of material frame indifference One of the most important constraints, arguably, on the form of constitutive behavior is the principle of material frame indifference . This complicated sounding name is, in essesnce, identical to the observer invariance of the constitutive relations (with respect to Euclidean observer transformations). Recall that our entire development of the balance principles of continuum mechanics hinged upon the central idea that the laws of thermodynamics are observer invariant. It is evident that since constitutive laws are also part of the physical description of the material, they cannot depend on the observer. The principle of material frame indifference is essentially a statement of this fact, with one important additional constraint, namely the form invariance of the constitutive laws with respect to Euclidean observer transformations. The form invariance postulate, which is implicit in the material frame indifference postulate, states that the functional form of the the constitutive relation is also invariant with respect to Euclidean observer transformations. Rather than explaining these in very general terms, it is perhaps better to focus on specific forms of constitutive relations and explain the consequences of the principle of material frame indifference in the process. Throughout this discussion, we will assume that \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ are two observers who are related by the Euclidean transformation \\mathsf{x}^+ = \\mathsf{c} + \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{x},\\qquad t^+ = t. Note that both \\mathsf{c} and \\mathsf{Q} are functions of time, in general. Example To start with, let us consider a constitutive relation of the form \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)). To keep the notation simple, we will often abbreviate this as \\sigma = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\mathsf{v}) , with the implicit assumption that the constitive relation is local. Note also that the constitutive relation, as written above, is with respect to an observer \\mathcal{O} . The same constitutive relation takes the following form with respect to the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ : \\sigma^+ = \\hat{\\sigma}^+(\\mathsf{v}^+). The form invariance postulate means that the specific functional form characterizing \\hat{\\sigma} , namely the relation between the Cauchy stress \\sigma and the spatial velocity \\mathsf{v} is invariant with respect to Euclidean observer transformations. We thus have \\sigma^+ = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\mathsf{v}^+). Recall that the spatial velocity transforms as follows: \\mathsf{v}^+ = \\dot{\\mathsf{c}} + \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{v} + \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}\\mathsf{x}. The Cauchy stress tensor, on the other hand, is objective and transforms as \\sigma^+ = \\mathsf{Q} \\sigma \\mathsf{Q}^T. To see why, note that the equation for the traction vector according to \\mathcal{O} , \\mathsf{t} = \\sigma\\mathsf{n} , where \\mathsf{n} is an appropriately defined normal vector, can be written with respect to \\mathcal{O}^+ as \\mathsf{t}^+ = \\sigma^+\\mathsf{n}^+. Noting that both the traction vector and normal vector are objective, the objectivity of the Cauchy stress tensor follows. Using these results, it follows that \\mathsf{Q}\\sigma\\mathsf{Q}^T = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\dot{\\mathsf{c}} + \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{v} + \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}\\mathsf{x}). As a special case, let us consider the situation where \\mathsf{Q}(t) \\equiv \\mathsf{I} . Since the foregoing relation is also valid in case, we see that \\sigma = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\mathsf{v} + \\dot{c}), for every admissible \\dot{\\mathsf{c}} . This is clearly not possible. What this means is that, according to the principle of material frame indifference, it is inadmissible to have a constitutive relation of the form \\sigma = \\hat{\\sigma}(\\mathsf{v}) ! Example As another example, let us consider a constitutive relation of the form \\sigma = \\mathcal{F}(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}), according to oberver \\mathcal{O} . The same relation, when viewed by observer \\mathcal{O}^+ takes the form \\sigma^+ = \\mathcal{F}(\\text{grad}^+\\,\\mathsf{v}^+). Notice how we have tacitly used the form invariance postulate in writing this expression. To compute \\text{grad}^+\\,\\mathsf{v}^+ , let us work in a Cartesian coordinate setting. Since the velocities transform as v_i^+ = \\dot{c}_i + \\sum Q_{ij}v_j + \\sum \\dot{Q}_{ij}x_j as a consequene of the Euclidean observer transformation, we see that \\begin{split} \\frac{\\partial v_i^+}{\\partial x_j^+} &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i^+}{\\partial x_k}\\frac{\\partial x_k}{\\partial x_j^+}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k}\\left(\\sum Q_{il}v_l + \\sum \\dot{Q}_{il}x_l\\right)Q_{jk}\\\\ &= \\sum Q_{il}\\frac{\\partial v_l}{\\partial x_k}Q_{jk} + \\sum \\dot{Q}_{ik}Q_{jk}. \\end{split} In deriving this equation, we have made use of the fact that x_i^+ = c_i + \\sum Q_{ij}x_j \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{\\partial x_k}{\\partial x_j^+} = Q_{jk}. The final result can be expressed in invariant form as \\text{grad}^+\\mathsf{v}^+ = \\mathsf{Q}(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v})\\mathsf{Q}^T + \\Omega. Here, \\Omega = \\mathsf{Q}\\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}^T . It is left as a straightforward exercise to check this - expand this coordinate free result stated above using Cartesian coordinates and note that \\mathsf{Q} = \\sum \\mathsf{e}^+_i \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i . The transformation rule derived above shows that that the gradient of the velocity field is not an objective tensor field; this is primarily a consequence of the additional term \\Omega , which can be chosen arbitrarily. So a constitutive relation of the form \\sigma = \\mathcal{F}(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}) is not observer invariant. A simple means to fix this problem is by noting that the rate of deformation tensor, \\mathsf{d} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} + (\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v})^T\\right) is indeed objective. In other words, \\mathsf{d}^+ = \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{d}\\mathsf{Q}^T. This follows from the fact that \\Omega is skew symmetric, which in turn follows from the orthogonality of \\mathsf{Q}(t) for every t . Thus, if we postulate a constitutive relation of the form \\sigma = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathsf{d}), then this is a valid form of the constitutive law as long as the function \\mathcal{F} satisfies the following property \\mathsf{Q}\\mathcal{F}(\\mathsf{d})\\mathsf{Q}^T = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{d}\\mathsf{Q}^T), for every \\mathsf{Q} \\in SO(3) . These examples illustrate how the requirement of observer invariance places definite restrictions on the form of the constitutive relation. We will explore some elementary, but important, constitutive relations in the context of fluids in the next chapter, followed by a discussion of elastic solids .","title":"Constitutive modeling"},{"location":"constitutive_modeling/#general-principles-of-constitutive-modeling","text":"We will now introduce the topic of constitutive modeling , in a simplified setting.

Notice how we have tacitly used the form invariance postulate in writing this expression. To compute \\text{grad}^+\\,\\mathsf{v}^+ , let us work in a Cartesian coordinate setting. Since the velocities transform as v_i^+ = \\dot{c}_i + \\sum Q_{ij}v_j + \\sum \\dot{Q}_{ij}x_j as a consequene of the Euclidean observer transformation, we see that \\begin{split} \\frac{\\partial v_i^+}{\\partial x_j^+} &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i^+}{\\partial x_k}\\frac{\\partial x_k}{\\partial x_j^+}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k}\\left(\\sum Q_{il}v_l + \\sum \\dot{Q}_{il}x_l\\right)Q_{jk}\\\\ &= \\sum Q_{il}\\frac{\\partial v_l}{\\partial x_k}Q_{jk} + \\sum \\dot{Q}_{ik}Q_{jk}. \\end{split} In deriving this equation, we have made use of the fact that x_i^+ = c_i + \\sum Q_{ij}x_j \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{\\partial x_k}{\\partial x_j^+} = Q_{jk}. The final result can be expressed in invariant form as \\text{grad}^+\\mathsf{v}^+ = \\mathsf{Q}(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v})\\mathsf{Q}^T + \\Omega. Here, \\Omega = \\mathsf{Q}\\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}^T . It is left as a straightforward exercise to check this - expand this coordinate free result stated above using Cartesian coordinates and note that \\mathsf{Q} = \\sum \\mathsf{e}^+_i \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i . The transformation rule derived above shows that that the gradient of the velocity field is not an objective tensor field; this is primarily a consequence of the additional term \\Omega , which can be chosen arbitrarily. So a constitutive relation of the form \\sigma = \\mathcal{F}(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}) is not observer invariant. A simple means to fix this problem is by noting that the rate of deformation tensor, \\mathsf{d} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} + (\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v})^T\\right) is indeed objective. In other words, \\mathsf{d}^+ = \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{d}\\mathsf{Q}^T. This follows from the fact that \\Omega is skew symmetric, which in turn follows from the orthogonality of \\mathsf{Q}(t) for every t . Thus, if we postulate a constitutive relation of the form \\sigma = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathsf{d}), then this is a valid form of the constitutive law as long as the function \\mathcal{F} satisfies the following property \\mathsf{Q}\\mathcal{F}(\\mathsf{d})\\mathsf{Q}^T = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{d}\\mathsf{Q}^T), for every \\mathsf{Q} \\in SO(3) . These examples illustrate how the requirement of observer invariance places definite restrictions on the form of the constitutive relation. We will explore some elementary, but important, constitutive relations in the context of fluids in the next chapter, followed by a discussion of elastic solids .","title":"Principle of material frame indifference"},{"location":"fluid_dynamics/","text":"Elementary fluid dynamics As a simple application of the constitutive theory developed so far, let us look into a special class of fluids called Newtonian fluids. This will result in the famous Navier-Stokes equation in fluid dynamics. This will be followed by a simple example, called Poiseuille flow , to illustrate how it all comes together. Newtonian viscous fluids Let us now consider the special case of a constitutive relation of the form \\sigma = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathsf{d}). We saw in our previous discussin of constitutive models that this form of the constitutive model is objective provided the function $\\mathcal{F}$ satisfies the constraint, \\mathsf{Q}\\mathcal{F}(\\mathsf{d})\\mathsf{Q}^T = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{d}\\mathsf{Q}^T), for every \\mathsf{Q} \\in SO(3) . It can be shonw that the most general form of $\\mathcal{F}$ that is compatible with this constraint has the following structure, \\mathcal{F}(\\mathsf{d}) = a_0 \\mathsf{I} + a_1 \\mathsf{d} + a_2 \\mathsf{d}^2, where $a_0, a_1, a_2$ are constants. A material whose constitutive relation of this form is called a non-Newtonian fluid , or a Reiner-Rivlin fluid . As a special case of a Reiner-Rivlin fluid, let us consider the case of a linear viscous fluid , also called a Newtonian viscous fluid , which is characterized by a constitutive relation of the form \\sigma = -p(\\rho)\\mathsf{I} + \\lambda \\,\\text{tr}(\\mathsf{d})\\mathsf{I} + 2\\eta\\mathsf{d}, where $\\lambda,\\mu$ are positive constants, and $p(\\rho)$ is a function of the density called the pressure of the fluid. Let us see how the mass and momentum balance equations change as a consequence of this constituive assumption. The mass continuity equation remains unchanged since it does not involve the Cauchy stress tensor. The linear momentum balance equation, on the other hand, takes the following form: \\rho\\frac{D\\mathsf{v}}{Dt} = \\rho\\mathsf{b} - \\text{grad }p + (\\lambda + \\eta)\\,\\text{grad div }\\mathsf{v} + \\eta\\,\\text{div grad }\\mathsf{v}. This equation is called the Navier-Stokes equation , and plays a central role in continuum mechanics. Note that this equaiton, along with the mass continuity equation, provides a closed system of equations for the mass density $\\rho$ and the spatial velocity $\\mathsf{v}$. When supplied with the appropriate initial and boundary conditions, we can, in principle at least, solve the resulting set of partial differential equations. Remark In deriving the Navier-Stokes equation, we used the following result: \\text{div }\\sigma = - \\text{grad }p + (\\lambda + \\eta)\\,\\text{grad div }\\mathsf{v} + \\eta\\,\\text{div grad }\\mathsf{v}. This is most easily shown by taking recourse to a Cartesian coordinate system, as the following calculation illustrates: \\begin{split} (\\text{div }\\sigma)_i &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j}\\\\ &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}\\left(-p\\delta_{ij} + \\lambda \\left(\\sum \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial x_k}\\right)\\delta_{ij} + \\eta\\left(\\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial v_j}{\\partial x_i}\\right)\\right)\\\\ &= -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x_i} + (\\lambda + \\eta)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\left(\\sum \\frac{\\partial v_k}{\\partial x_k}\\right) + \\eta\\frac{\\partial^2 v_i}{\\partial x_j\\partial x_j}. \\end{split} Subsituting this in the linear momentum balance equation yields the Navier-Stokes equation. In the special case of an incompressible fluid , we can simplify the mass continuity equation as follows: \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} = 0 \\quad\\Leftrightarrow\\quad \\text{div }v = 0. It is easily checked that the Navier-Stokes equation for an incompressible fluid takes the following form: \\rho\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{v}}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v}\\right) = \\rho \\mathsf{b} - \\text{grad }p + \\eta\\,\\text{div grad }\\mathsf{v}. This equation, along with the incompressibility constraint, is known as the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation . Notice that the only unknown in this case is the velocity field. Remark Incompressibility is a very useful and satisfactory approximation for fluids whose flow speeds are much smaller than the speed of sound in that fluid. The study of incompressible fluids constitutes an important branch of fluid dynamics, but we will not explore this in any detail in this course. Guess what! Proving the existence of solutions for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is famously one of the Millenium Problems listed by the Clay Mathematics Institute; see this page for more details. You can become a millionaire and achieve a permanent place in the history of science if you crack this! Poiseuille flow Let us now look at simple example, called a Poiseuille flow , of an application of the theory developed so far. This will illustrate how everything that we have studied thus far comes together. The problem we will study is that of the steady flow of an inompressible Newtonian viscous fluid through a pipe of constant cross sectional area. The geometry of the flow is illustrated below: As an idealization, we consider a two dimensional pipe of length L and cross sectional width h . Equivalently, this can be looked at as a a semi-infinite pipe with infinite extension along the out-of-plane direction. The steady flow in the pipe is caused by a pressure difference \\Delta P = P_1 - P_2 > 0 . Let us now see how to solve this problem using the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. What does this mean? Recall that the only unknown in this case is the velocity field. What we understand by a solution is the computation of the velocity field given all the information above. Let us start by writing out the mass and linear momentum balance equations for the steady state flow of an incompressible Newtonian viscous fluid: \\begin{split} \\text{div }\\mathsf{v} &= 0,\\\\ \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} &= -\\text{grad }p + \\eta\\,\\text{div grad }\\mathsf{v}. \\end{split} To solve these equations, we need to augment them with the appropriate initial and boundary conditions. In addition to the pressure being specified at the two ends of the pipe, we will also need the no-slip boundary condition on the walls for the velocity field. This cnidition requires that the velocity vanishes at the fluid-wall interface at y = \\pm h/2 . Remark The origin of the no-slip boundary condition lies in the details of the interaction between the fluid and wall particles, and cannot be obtained from purely thermodynamic considerations alone. For our purposes, it can be taken to be an experimental fact. Let us now look at the velocity field. By symmetry, we do not expect any flow along the y and z directions. Thus, a general form of the velocity field for the present problem can be written as \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x}) = u(x,y) \\mathsf{e}_x. The incompressibility constraint, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v} = 0 , implies that \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x}) = u(y)\\mathsf{e}_x. To get the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation for this case, note that \\begin{split} \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} &= \\sum v_j\\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j} \\mathsf{e}_i = u(y)\\frac{\\partial u(y)}{\\partial x}\\mathsf{e}_x = 0,\\\\ \\text{grad }p &= \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\mathsf{e}_x + \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}\\mathsf{e}_y + \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}\\mathsf{e}_z,\\\\ \\text{div grad }\\mathsf{v} &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial^2 v_i}{\\partial x_j\\partial x_j} \\mathsf{e}_i = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\mathsf{e}_x. \\end{split} Using these results in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, we get the following simple equation: \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\eta \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = 0. The latter equations imply that the pressure is only a function of the x variable. The former equation then tells us that the left hand side, namely \\partial p/\\partial x , is just a function of x , while the right hand side, namely \\eta\\,\\partial^2 u/\\partial y^2 , is a function of y only. The only way this equation can be satisfied, therefore, is when the two are simultaneously equal to some constant, say C : \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\eta \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = C. Solving the equation \\partial p/\\partial x = C , along with the boundary conditions that the pressure at x = 0 is P_1 and the pressure at x = L is P_2 , yields the following: C = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}, \\qquad p(x) = P_1 - \\frac{\\Delta P}{L}x. The remaining equation to be solved is \\eta\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}, subject to the no-slip boundary conditions, u\\left(\\pm \\frac{h}{2}\\right) = 0. A straightforward computation yields the desired solution, u(y) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L}\\left(\\frac{h^2}{4} - y^2\\right). As a consistency check, note that u \\equiv 0 when \\Delta P = 0 . This simply states that there is no flow if there is no external pressure gradient to drive it. The velocity profile across the cross-section of the pipe is shown below: The velocity profile is parabolic and vanishes at the walls of the pipe as required by the no-slip boundary conditions. Note also that the maximum velocity is attained at the center of the pipe. Remark The foregoing conclusion that the maximum flow velocity is at the center of the pipe is also true in the case of a Poiseuille flow in a circular pipe. The details are left as a simple exercise.","title":"Fluid dynamics"},{"location":"fluid_dynamics/#elementary-fluid-dynamics","text":"As a simple application of the constitutive theory developed so far, let us look into a special class of fluids called Newtonian fluids.

To understand this, we first need to understand the notion of objectivity of tensor fields. In the process of proving the Green-Naghdi-Rivlin theorem, we will also introduce the crucial notion of the stress tensor . Observer transformations Recall from our discussion of kinematics that an observer is characterized by a map that assigns to each event in spacetime a unique coordinate in \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} . If two different observers, \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ , assign coordinates \\mathsf{x},t and \\mathsf{x}^+,t^+ , respectively, for the same event, then the map (\\mathsf{x},t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} \\to (\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} is called an observer transformation . Note that an observer transformation is a diffeomorphism of spacetime. This means that the map displayed above is continuously differentiable, and invertible, with the inverse also being continuously differentiable. Remark The reason for using the notation (\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) for the space and time coordinates for the second observer is simply to emphasize that we will shortly focus on a special class of observer transformations that can alternatively also be interpreted as a superimposed rigid body motion . Let us now focus on a special class of observer transformations, namely those that preserve the distance between two points in space, and the time interval between two events. To make this concrete, suppose that we consider two events, which have spacetime coordinates (\\mathsf{x}_1,t_1) and (\\mathsf{x}_2,t_2) according to observer \\mathcal{O} . Let the space and time coordinates of the same event with respect to another observer \\mathcal{O}^+ be (\\mathsf{x}_2^+,t_2^+) . The requirement that the two observers measure the same distance between these two points and record the same time interval between these two events can be expressed using the following equations: \\begin{split} \\lVert \\mathsf{x}_1 - \\mathsf{x}_2 \\rVert &= \\lVert \\mathsf{x}_1^+ - \\mathsf{x}_2^+ \\rVert,\\\\ t_1 - t_2 &= t_1^+ - t_2^+. \\end{split} A general class of observer transformations that satisfies this requirement can be written as \\begin{split} \\mathsf{x}^+(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\mathsf{c}(t) + \\mathsf{Q}(t)(\\mathsf{x} - \\mathsf{x}_0),\\\\ t^+(\\mathsf{x},t) &= t, \\end{split} as can be easily verified. Here, \\mathsf{c}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , \\mathsf{x}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , and \\mathsf{Q}(t) \\in SO(3) for every t \\in \\mathbb{R} . For the sake of notational succinctness, we will write \\mathsf{x}^+ and \\mathsf{t}^+ for \\mathsf{x}^+(\\mathsf{x},t) and t^+(\\mathsf{x},t) , respectively. Observer transformations of this form are called Euclidean transformations . In the special case when we insist that \\mathsf{c}(t) = \\mathsf{c}_0t for some constant vector \\mathsf{c}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , and \\mathsf{Q}(t) = \\mathsf{Q}_0 for some constant \\mathsf{Q}_0 \\in SO(3) , these observer transformations are called Galilean transformations . Remark In special relativity, one considers observers who agree upon the proper time interval between two events. Given two events with coordinates (\\mathsf{x}_1,t_1) and (\\mathsf{x}_2,t_2) according to an observer, the proper time interval between these two events is defined as \\Delta \\tau = c^2(t_1 - t_2)^2 - \\lVert \\mathsf{x}_1 - \\mathsf{x}_2\\rVert^2. Here, c \\in \\mathbb{R} stands for the velocity of light in vacuum. In special relativity, two consenting observers agree only upon the proper time interval. Notice that this does not require them to agree upon distances between two points in space, or the time time interval between two events, in sharp constrast to classical (Newtonian) physics. Galilean transformations are used in the classical principle of relativity: the laws of classical physics remain invariant with respect to Galilean transformations. In continuum mechanics, we will postulate the invariance of the continuum analogues of the first and second laws of thermodynamics with respect to Euclidean transformations. This is the key idea behind the Green-Naghdi-Rivlin theorem. Objectivity We will now introduce a crucial concept called objectivity for scalar, vector and tensor fields. Throughout this discussion we will assume that we have two observers \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ who are related to each other according to a Euclidean transformation. We will use the same convention to denote space and time coordinates of an event according to these observers as in the previous section. Scalar fields Let us start with the simple case of a scalar field f:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} , as measured by the observer \\mathcal{O} . Let us denote the same scalar field, as measured by the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ , as f^+:\\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} . The scalar field is said to be objective if f(\\mathsf{x},t) = f^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+). To better appreciate the notion of objectivity, consider the temperature field \\hat{\\Theta}_t:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R} of a continuum body \\mathcal{B} at the current time instant t . As measured by the observer \\mathcal{O} , the temperature at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t can be written as \\theta(\\mathsf{x},t) . With respect to the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ , the temperature of the point \\mathsf{x}^+(\\mathsf{x},t) \\in B_t^+ is given by \\theta^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) . It is evident that both these observers measure the same value of the temperature at the same material point. Equivalently, we see that the temperature field is objective. Vector fields The spacetime diffeomorphism characterizing an observer transformation naturally induces a basis at each tangent space to \\mathbb{R}^3 . Let (\\mathsf{e}_i) be a basis to the tangent space at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , according to the observer \\mathcal{O} . The corresponding basis (\\mathsf{e}_i^+) of the tangent space T_{\\mathsf{x}^+}\\mathbb{R}^3 according to the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ can be computed as follows: \\mathsf{e}_i^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = \\nabla \\mathsf{x}^+(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{e}_i = \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{e}_i. Remark Note that \\mathsf{Q}(t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}^+}\\mathbb{R}^3 , and can be written as Q(t) = \\sum \\mathsf{e}_i^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i. It is easy to verify the orthogonality of Q(t) directly using this expression. Note that a similar expression applies for \\mathsf{Q}^T(t):T_{\\mathsf{x}^+}\\mathbb{R}^3 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 . A vector field \\mathsf{w} on \\mathbb{R}^3 is said to be objective if \\mathsf{w}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t). To understand what this means, let us compute the local representation of the vector field according to both observers. According to \\mathcal{O} , let \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sum w_i(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{e}_i. If \\mathsf{w} is an objective vector field, then its representation with respect to \\mathcal{O}^+ is computed as \\begin{split} \\mathsf{w}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) &= \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\left(\\sum w_i(\\mathsf{x},t) \\mathsf{e}_i\\right)\\\\ &= \\sum w_i(\\mathsf{x},t) \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{e}_i\\\\ &= \\sum w_i(\\mathsf{x},t) \\mathsf{e}_i^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+). \\end{split} Comparing this with the coordinate representation \\mathsf{w}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = \\sum w_i^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) \\mathsf{e}_i^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) of the vector field according to the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ , we see that, for i = 1,2,3 , w_i^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = w_i(\\mathsf{x},t). In other words, the components fields of an objective vector field are objective scalar fields. The physical intuition behind this is that if a vector field is objective, then a Euclidean transformation just rotates the basis vectors of each tangent space uniformly , but doesn't affect the components of an objective vector field with respect to these bases. In other words, an objective vector field rotates along with the observer globally . Tensor fields The objectivity of tensor fields is defined in a manner analogous to that of vector fields. If \\mathsf{A} is a tensor field of order k on \\mathbb{R}^3 , its component representation according to observer \\mathcal{O} can be written as \\mathsf{A}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sum A_{i_1\\ldots i_k}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, \\mathsf{e}_{i_1} \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_{i_k}. The tensor field \\mathsf{A} is said to be objective if, according to the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ who is related to the observer \\mathcal{O} by a Euclidean transformation, the tensor field admits the representation \\mathsf{A}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = \\sum A_{i_1\\ldots i_k}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, \\mathsf{e}_{i_1}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_{i_k}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+). There are many equivalent ways of expressing this. For instance, the foregoing equation can be written as \\mathsf{A}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = \\sum A_{i_1\\ldots i_k}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{e}_{i_1} \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes \\mathsf{Q}(t) \\mathsf{e}_{i_k}. In terms of the components of the tensor fields, we can express the condition for objectivity as A_{i_1\\ldots i_k}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = A_{i_1\\ldots i_k}(\\mathsf{x},t). An analogous interpretation of the objectivity of tensor fields as in the case of vector fields should be evident. Owing to its practical utility, it is useful to consider the special case of a second order tensor field. In this case, the objectivity condition for a second order tensor field \\mathsf{A} can be expressed compactly as follows: \\mathsf{A}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{A}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{Q}^T(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+). This can be easily verified by an explicit computation, and is left as a simple exercise. This form of the objectivity condition for second order tensors will be used extensively in the sequel. Remark To keep the notation manageable, we will often drop the arguments and write the objectivity condition for a second order tensor field as just \\mathsf{A}^+ = \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{Q}^T . Objectivity of continuum fields As should be clear now, we would ideally like the various scalar, vector and tensor fields that enter a continuum description of the first and second laws of thermodynamics need to be objective. The reason is that this enforces observer invariance of the various continuum fields involved. Let us now make this notion formally precise. As before, we will be dealing with two observers \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ who are related according to a Euclidean transformation. To begin with, we will postulate that all the scalar fields involved in the first and second laws of thermodynamics are objective. To be specific, we postulate the following relations: \\begin{split} \\rho^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) &= \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t),\\\\ e^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) &= e(\\mathsf{x},t),\\\\ r^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) &= r(\\mathsf{x},t),\\\\ \\eta^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) &= \\eta(\\mathsf{x},t),\\\\ \\theta^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) &= \\theta(\\mathsf{x},t),\\\\ h^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+,\\mathsf{n}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)) &= h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)). \\end{split} Notice how the unit normal figures in the last expression. Since a unit normal is an element of the appropriate tangent space, it transforms objectively: \\mathsf{n}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) . Let us now turn to the various vector fields that figure in the first law of thermodynamics. To start with, consider the simple case of a particle moving in three dimensional space such that at time t \\in I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} , the particle occupies position \\mathsf{x}(t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^3 , according to observer \\mathcal{O} . The velocity and acceleration of this particle, as observed by \\mathcal{O} are given by \\dot{\\mathsf{x}}(t) = d\\mathsf{x}(t)/dt and \\ddot{\\mathsf{x}}(t) = d^2\\mathsf{x}(t)/dt^2 , respectively. Let us now compute how the motion of the same particle according to an observer \\mathcal{O}^+ who is related to \\mathcal{O} by a general Euclidean transformation, \\mathsf{x}^+(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{c}(t) + \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{x}, \\qquad t^+ = t, looks like. The position, velocity and acceleration of the same particle as observed by \\mathcal{O}^+ can be easily computed as \\begin{split} \\mathsf{x}^+(t) &= \\mathsf{c}(t) + \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{x}(t),\\\\ \\mathsf{v}^+(t) &= \\dot{\\mathsf{c}}(t) + \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}(t)\\mathsf{x}(t) + \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{v}(t),\\\\ \\mathsf{a}^+(t) &= \\ddot{\\mathsf{c}}(t) + \\ddot{\\mathsf{Q}}(t)\\mathsf{x}(t) + 2\\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}(t)\\mathsf{v}(t) + \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{a}(t). \\end{split} Remark Notice the close similarity between the first equation in the list of three equations above, and the Euclidean transformation relation observers \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ . In the former, \\mathsf{x}(t) is a time dependent trajectory of a particle in three dimensional space. In the latter, \\mathsf{x} stands for a generic point in space, and has no time dependence at all. The meaning of equations like these should always be inferred carefully from the appropriate context. Note that neither the velocity, nor the acceleration of the particle, are objective vector fields in general. In the special case of a Galilean transformation, howevever, when \\mathsf{c}(t) = \\mathsf{c}_0 t for some constant \\mathsf{c}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , and when \\mathsf{Q}(t) = \\mathsf{Q}_0 for some constant rotation map \\mathsf{Q}_0 \\in SO(3) , we see that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{v}^+(t) &= \\mathsf{c}_0 + \\mathsf{Q}_0\\mathsf{v}(t),\\\\ \\mathsf{a}^+(t) &= \\mathsf{Q}_0\\mathsf{a}(t). \\end{split} We thus see that the velocity vector is still not objective, but the acceleration is in fact an objective vector. This is the familiar result in elementary classical physics that if two observers are moving relative to each other with a constant velocity, then they will measure the same acceleration of any moving body they observe, but disagree on the velocity. Let us now move on to the other vector fields appearing in the first law of thermodynamics. Let us look at the surface traction first. Recall that the traction vector was introducted to model the surface force on a continuum. Thus, given any small areal \\Delta a centered at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t with normal \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) , we modeled the force acting on this small area as \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\Delta a . We will now extend the traction defined on the surface \\partial B_t to the whole of B_t so that given any \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t and \\mathsf{n} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , we have uniquely defined vector \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . The idea behind this extension is that we can compute a force on every infinitesimal area at every point in the continuum, as shown in the following figure: We will take it as a basic postulate of continuum mechanics that this extension is always well-defined. The simplest means to appreciate this postulate is by going back to the spring mass analogy given earlier - any force applied on the surface atoms percolates to the interior as a consequence of the collective response of all the springs to the applied force. We are now in a position to state an important postulate: we will henceforth consider the traction vector field as being objective. This means that if two observers \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ who are related by a Euclidean transformation observe the same process, then \\mathsf{t}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+,\\mathsf{n}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)) = \\mathsf{Q}(t) \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)). To understand the rationale behind the postulate concerning the objectivity of the traction vector field, note that the traction vector represents the internal response of the continuum due to externally applied forces and energy supplied in the form of heat. Thus the postulate that the traction vector field is objective simply means that this internal response of the continuum is independent of observer transformations. Remark Another way of rationalizing this is to note that when viewed from the atomistic viewpoint, the energy of a collection of atoms, called an interatomic potential , can only depend on the relative positions of the atoms, and not on their absolute positions, if the energy is to describe a physically realistic internal energy that is invariant with respect to translations and rotations. Since Euclidean transformations do not change the relative positions of the atoms, it makes sense to postulate that the traction vector field is objective. Note that the need to make this a postulate is simply because the continuum is a mathematical construct, and the behavior of dynamical fields defined on the continuum need to be postulated based on the behavior of their true atomistic counterparts. Finally, let us turn to the body force density. Rather than talk about the body force density \\mathsf{b} directly, we will consider instead the quantity \\mathsf{b} - \\mathsf{a} , and postulate that this quantity is objective. Thus, from the point of view of two observers \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ who are related by a Euclidean transformation, we postulate that \\mathsf{b}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) - \\mathsf{a}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = \\mathsf{Q}(t)(\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t)). Recall that we studied the transformation rules for the spatial accleration (which is not an objective vector field) earlier. Using that in conjunction with the equation presented above gives the observer transformation rule for the body force density. To understand the idea behind this postulate, it is helpful to consider a very simple system of a mass connected by a spring to a stationary point. Assuming the spring to be linear with a spring constant k , the equation governing the dynamics of the mass when subject to a force mb , according to observer \\mathcal{O} , is given by mb - k(x - x_0) = ma. Here, \\mathsf{x}_0 is the coordinate of the fixed point to which the spring is attached. The same equation takes the following form according to an observer \\mathcal{O}^+ who is related to \\mathcal{O} by a Euclidean transformation: mb^+ - k(x^+ - x_0^+) = ma^+. Using the fact that x^+ - x_0^+ = \\mathsf{Q}(t)(x - x_0) , it is easy to see that b^+ - a^+ = Q(b - a). This is just the transformation rule postulated earlier. While this does not prove the postulate (which is why it is a postulate in the first place), it provides a simple means to appreciate why the postulate is formulated in its specific form. Observer invariance of the second law of thermodynamics We have now all the necessary tools to study the consequences of requiring that the first and second laws of thermodynamics are invariant with respect to Euclidean observer transformations. We will start with the second law of thermodynamics since it is much easier to deal with. Let \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ be two observers who are related by a Euclidean transformation. Let us write the second law according to the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ : \\frac{d}{dt^+}\\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) \\, dv^+ \\ge \\int_{B_t^+} \\frac{\\rho^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)r^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)}{\\theta^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)} \\, dv^+ - \\int_{\\partial B_t^+} \\frac{h^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+,\\mathsf{n}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+))}{\\theta^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)}\\,da^+. Let us now change the variables from (\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) to (\\mathsf{x},t) . Since the second law involves only scalar fields, each of which is objective, the transformation of the integrands is trivial. The volume and area integrals transform according to the usual change of variables rules that we studied earlier. Specifically, note that for any scalar field f:B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} , \\begin{split} \\int_{B_t^+} f^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)\\eta^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)\\,dv^+ &= \\int_{B_t} f(\\mathsf{x},t) \\text{det}(\\mathsf{Q}(t))\\,dv\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. \\end{split} In deriving the last expression, we used the fact that \\mathsf{Q}(t) is orthogonal. To understand how area integrals transform, let us revisit the change of area formula in the case of a Euclidean observer transformation: \\mathsf{n}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)\\Delta a^+ = \\text{det}(\\mathsf{Q}(t))\\mathsf{Q}^{-T}\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta a. Noting that \\mathsf{Q}^{-T}(t) = \\mathsf{Q}(t) and that \\mathsf{n}^+ = \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{n} , it follows that \\Delta a^+ = \\Delta a . We can thus transform the area integral of a scalar field g:B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} as: \\int_{\\partial B_t^+} g^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)\\,da^+ = \\int_{\\partial B_t} g(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da. Putting all this together, we can transform the second law as observed by the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ as \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\eta(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv \\ge \\int_{B_t} \\frac{\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)}\\,dv - \\int_{B_t} \\frac{h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))}{\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)}\\,da. But this is precisely the second law as recorded by the observer \\mathcal{O} . We thus see that the second law of thermodynamics is naturally invariant with respect to Euclidean observer transformations. In other words, there are no additional restrictions on the various scalar fields in the second law as a consequence of Euclidean observer invariance. Observer invariance of the first law of thermodynamics Unlike the second law of thermodynamics, we will see shortly that requiring the first law to be invariant with respect to Euclidean observer transformations yields very important and new information regarding the various continuum fields. In particular, we will see that the principles of conservation of mass, linear momentum and angular momentum, all follow from this basic invariance requirement. This remarkable result is known as the Green-Naghdi-Rivlin theorem . We will develop this in two stages: we will first study the consequences of requiring the first laws to be invariant with respect to observers who are moving relative to each other with a constant velocity, and subsequently with respect to observers who are rotating with respect to each other. Mass and linear momentum balance Let us first consider the case when the observers \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ are related to each other according to the following transformation: \\mathsf{x}^+ = \\mathsf{x} + \\mathsf{c}_0 t, \\quad t^+ = t. Here \\mathsf{c}_0\\in\\mathbb{R}^3 is a constant vector. Note that this is the constant velocity with which the two observers are moving relative to each other. Note also that \\mathsf{Q}(t) = \\mathsf{I} in this case. Let us write the first law of thermodynamics according to the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ : \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt^+}\\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+\\left(e^+ + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}^+\\cdot\\mathsf{v}^+\\right)\\,dv^+ &= \\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+ \\mathsf{b}^+\\cdot\\mathsf{v}^+\\,dv^+ + \\int_{\\partial B_t^+} \\mathsf{t}^+\\cdot\\mathsf{v}^+\\,da^+\\\\ & + \\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+r^+\\,dv^+ - \\int_{\\partial B_t^+} h^+\\,da^+. \\end{split} Note that we have dropped all the arguments in the equation above to keep the notation manageable. Let us now transform the coordinates from (\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) to (\\mathsf{x},t) . Using the transformation rules derived earlier, we seee that all the scalar fields remain invariant, and the vector fields involved transform as follows: \\begin{split} \\mathsf{v}^+ &= \\mathsf{v} + \\mathsf{c}_0,\\\\ \\mathsf{a}^+ &= \\mathsf{a},\\\\ \\mathsf{b}^+ &= \\mathsf{b},\\\\ \\mathsf{t}^+ &= \\mathsf{t}. \\end{split} Using this, we can write the first law as follows: \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho\\left(e + \\frac{1}{2}((\\mathsf{v} + \\mathsf{c}_0)\\cdot(\\mathsf{v} + \\mathsf{c}_0)\\right)dv &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho \\mathsf{b} \\cdot (\\mathsf{v} + \\mathsf{c}_0) \\, dv\\\\ & + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t} \\cdot (\\mathsf{v} + \\mathsf{c}_0)\\, da\\\\ & + \\int_{B_t} \\rho r \\,dv - \\int_{\\partial B_t} h\\,da. \\end{split} Let us now consider the first law of thermodynamics according to the observer \\mathcal{O} : \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho\\left(e + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}\\cdot\\mathsf{v}\\right)\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\rho\\mathsf{b}\\cdot\\mathsf{v}\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t}\\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\mathsf{v}\\,da + \\int_{B_t} \\rho r \\, dv - \\int_{\\partial B_t} h\\,da. Since this equation and the transformed equation of the first law according to the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ that we presented earlier, we immediately get the following equation: \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho\\left(\\mathsf{v}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{c}_0\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\right)dv = \\int_{B_t} \\mathsf{b}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,da. Since this equation is true for arbitrary \\mathsf{c}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , writing the same equation for -\\mathsf{c}_0 and adding the two equations, we get \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{c}_0\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho\\,dv = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = 0. We thus see that the total mass contained in the region B_t is conserved. But this is precisely the law of conservation of mass. Taking the time derivative inside the integral, we see that \\int_{B_t} \\left(\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\rho\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}\\right) = 0. Using the localization lemma, we get the familiar mass continuity equation \\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = 0. Notice how the simple requirement that the first law of thermodynamics is invariant with respect to observers moving relative to each other with a constant velocity has already yielded the mass conservation equation! We're not done yet. Using the mass continuity equation in conjunction with the Reynolds' transport theorem, we see that, for any arbitray \\mathsf{c}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , \\int_{B_t} \\rho \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}}{Dt}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\mathsf{b}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,da. Note that we cannot directly localize this integral equation on account of the surface integral. Let us now look into this; in the process we will develop a crucial notion in continuum mechanics, that of the stress tensor . The kernel of the surface term \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0 is a function of \\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n} . The Cauchy localization lemma immediately implies the existence of a vector field \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0} on B_t such that \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0 = \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t), for every \\mathsf{c}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 . To understand how the vector field \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0} depends on \\mathsf{c}_0 , consider any arbitrary \\mathsf{c}_0,\\mathsf{c}_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 and a \\in \\mathbb{R} , and note that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0 + a\\mathsf{c}_1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot(\\mathsf{c}_0 + a\\mathsf{c}_1)\\\\ &= \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0 + a \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_1\\\\ &= \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) + a\\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t). \\end{split} We thus see that \\mathcal{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0} is a linear function of \\mathsf{c}_0 . This implies that there exists a linear map \\sigma(\\mathsf{x}, t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t such that \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sigma^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{c}_0. Remark Note that if \\sigma is a linear map, so is \\sigma^T . The reason for using the transpose of \\sigma in the equation \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sigma^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{c}_0 is primarily a matter of convention so that the components of \\sigma with respect to a chosen basis has the familiar interpretation used in engineering. Remark Note that the Cauchy localization lemma only shows the existence of a linear map of the form \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 . However, in our case, since B_t is an open subset of \\mathbb{R}^3 , we have the natural identity T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\equiv T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 . The reason for preferring T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t over T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 will become evident soon. The linear map, or equivalently, the second order tensor, \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) is called the Cauchy stress tensor . With this definition, we see that for every \\mathsf{c},\\mathsf{n} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n})\\cdot\\mathsf{c} = \\sigma^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{c} \\cdot \\mathsf{n} = \\mathsf{c} \\cdot \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{n}. Since this is true for every \\mathsf{c} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , we obtain the following expression relating the traction vector and the Cauchy stress tensor: \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) = \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{n}. This equation tells us that the Cauchy stress tensor allows us to compute the surface force acting on any infinitesimal area with a prescribed unit normal. To understand what the Cauchy stress tensor means, let us consider the component representation of the equation \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) = \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{n} with respect to an orthonormal basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) of T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t : t_i(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) = \\sum \\sigma_{ij}(\\mathsf{x},t) n_j, where \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sum \\sigma_{ij}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_j is the coordinate representation of the Cauchy stress tensor. To physically interpret the components of the Cauchy stress tensor, consider a cube with one of its vertices at \\mathsf{x}\\in B_t as shown below: We thus see that \\sigma_{ij}(\\mathsf{x},t) represents the force along the i^{\\text{th}} coordinate axis on an infinitesimal area element at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t whose normal is along the j^{\\text{th}} coordinate axis. Returning back to our discussion of the invariance of the first law of thermodynamics with respect to Euclidean observer transformations, let us use the Cauchy stress tensor to localize the equation \\int_{B_t} \\rho \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}}{Dt}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\mathsf{b}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,da. Using the fact that \\mathsf{t} = \\sigma\\mathsf{n} and using the divergence theorem, we see that \\begin{split} \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0 \\,da &= \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{c}_0 \\cdot \\sigma \\mathsf{n}\\,da\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\text{div}(\\mathsf{c}_0\\cdot\\sigma)\\,dv. \\end{split} Using this result, and the fact that \\mathsf{c}_0 is a constant vector, we obtain the following integral relation: \\int_{B_t} \\left(\\rho\\frac{D\\mathsf{v}}{Dt} - \\mathsf{b} - \\text{div }\\sigma\\right)\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv = 0. The localization lemma immediately yields the following differential equation: \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\frac{D\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\text{div }\\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t). This equation is the continuum analogue of Newton's second laws ma = F , and is hence called the linear momentum balance equation. The means to understand this physically is as follows. As a consequence of the application of external forces (both body forces and surface tractions), the continuum responds by generating generalized internal forces , which we have modeled using the Cauchy stress tensor. The term \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\text{div }\\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) thus represents the net force acting at an interior point \\mathsf{x}\\in B_t . This net force is equal to its acceleration \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) . We have thus obtained both the balance of mass and balance of linear momentum from the first law of thermodynamics by merely insisting that the first law is invariant with respect to two observers who are in relative motion with respect to each other with a constant velocity! Angular momentum balance In the previous section, we obtained both the mass and linear momentum conservation equations as a consequence of the invariance of the first law of thermodynamics with respect to Euclidean transformations characterized by a constant velocity relative motion of the observers. Let us now consider the consequences of the first law being invariant with respect to observers \\mathcal{O}, \\mathcal{O}^+ whose relative orientations change with time: \\mathsf{x}^+ = \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{x}, \\qquad t^+ = t. Note that this implies in particular that the velocity transforms as follows: \\mathsf{v}^+ = \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{v} + \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}(t)\\mathsf{x}. Before we get into the implications of this Euclidean observer transformation, let us note a few consequences of the fact that \\mathsf{Q}(t) is orthogonal. First, note that \\mathsf{Q}^T(t)\\mathsf{Q}(t) = \\mathsf{I} \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}^T(t)\\mathsf{Q}(t) + \\mathsf{Q}^T(t)\\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}(t) = \\mathsf{0}. Defining the linear map \\Omega(t):\\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 as \\Omega(t) = \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}^T(t)\\mathsf{Q}(t), it is evident that \\Omega(t) is skew-symmetric: \\Omega^T(t) = -\\Omega(t) . Let us now look into the first law of thermodynamics according to the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ : \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt^+}\\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+\\left(e^+ + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}^+\\cdot\\mathsf{v}^+\\right)\\,dv^+ &= \\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+ \\mathsf{b}^+\\cdot\\mathsf{v}^+\\,dv^+ + \\int_{\\partial B_t^+} \\mathsf{t}^+\\cdot\\mathsf{v}^+\\,da^+\\\\ & + \\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+r^+\\,dv^+ - \\int_{\\partial B_t^+} h^+\\,da^+. \\end{split} Let us rewrite this using the Reynolds' transport theorem: \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt^+}\\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+ e^+ \\, dv + \\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+ \\mathsf{a}^+\\cdot\\mathsf{v}^+ \\, dv^+ &= \\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+ \\mathsf{b}^+\\cdot\\mathsf{v}^+\\,dv^+ + \\int_{\\partial B_t^+} \\mathsf{t}^+\\cdot\\mathsf{v}^+\\,da^+\\\\ & + \\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+r^+\\,dv^+ - \\int_{\\partial B_t^+} h^+\\,da^+. \\end{split} Changing coordinates from (\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) to (\\mathsf{x},t) , and using the corresponding transformation rules for the various continuum fields, we get the following equation: \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho e \\,dv + \\int_{B_t} \\rho\\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{a} - \\mathsf{b})\\cdot(\\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{v} + \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}\\mathsf{x})\\,dv &= \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{t} \\cdot (\\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{v} + \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}\\mathsf{x}) \\, da\\\\ & + \\int_{B_t} \\rho r \\,dv - \\int_{\\partial B_t} h \\, da. \\end{split} Using the fact that \\mathsf{Q}(t) is orthogonal and the definition of \\Omega(t) , we can simplify the term \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{t} \\cdot (\\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{v} + \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}\\mathsf{x}) as follows: \\begin{split} \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{t} \\cdot (\\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{v} + \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}\\mathsf{x}) &= \\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\mathsf{Q}^T(\\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{v} + \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}\\mathsf{x})\\\\ &= \\mathsf{t}\\cdot(\\mathsf{v} + \\Omega \\mathsf{x}). \\end{split} The term \\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{a} - \\mathsf{b})\\cdot(\\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{v} + \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}\\mathsf{x}) can be simplified similarly. Putting all this in the first law, we get \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho e \\, dv + \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{a} - \\mathsf{b})\\cdot(\\mathsf{v} + \\Omega\\mathsf{x})\\,dv &= \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t} \\cdot (\\mathsf{v} + \\Omega\\mathsf{x}) \\, da\\\\ & + \\int_{B_t} \\rho r \\,dv - \\int_{\\partial B_t} h \\, da. \\end{split} Comparing this with the first law of thermodynamics according to the observer \\mathcal{O} , in conjunction with the Reynolds' transport theorem, \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho e \\, dv + \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{a} - \\mathsf{b})\\cdot\\mathsf{v}\\,dv = \\int_{\\partial B_t}\\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\mathsf{v}\\,da + \\int_{B_t} \\rho r \\, dv - \\int_{\\partial B_t} h\\,da, we immediately get the following equation: \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{a} - \\mathsf{b})\\cdot\\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\,dv = \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\,da. Let us now express the surface traction in terms of the Cauchy stress tensor, and the divergence theorem, to transform the surface integral in the right hand side into a volume integral as follows: \\begin{split} \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{a} - \\mathsf{b})\\cdot\\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\,dv &= \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\sigma\\mathsf{n}\\,da\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\text{div }(\\Omega \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\sigma)\\,dv. \\end{split} To proceed further, let us simplify the expression \\text{div }(\\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\sigma) . It is helpful to temporarily adopt a Cartesian coordinate system for this purpose: \\begin{split} \\text{div }(\\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\sigma) &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}(\\Omega_{ik}x_k\\sigma_{ij})\\\\ &= \\sum \\Omega_{ij}\\sigma_{ij} + \\sum W_{ik}x_k\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j}\\\\ &= \\sigma \\cdot \\Omega + \\Omega \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\text{div }\\sigma. \\end{split} Using this in the result, we see that \\int_{B_t} \\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\cdot(\\rho\\mathsf{a} - \\rho\\mathsf{b} - \\text{div }\\sigma)\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\sigma \\cdot \\Omega \\,dv. The term on the left hand side of this equation vanishes on account of the balance of linear momentum that was discussed earlier. We thus arrive at the following equation: \\int_{B_t} \\sigma \\cdot \\Omega\\, dv = 0. The localization principle immediately yields the relation \\sigma \\cdot \\Omega = 0, for every skew-symmetric map \\Omega . Noting that the skew-symmetry of \\Omega permits us to write \\Omega = (\\Omega - \\Omega^T)/2 , we see that 0 = \\sigma \\cdot \\Omega = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma \\cdot (\\Omega - \\Omega^T), and hence that \\sigma\\cdot\\Omega^T = \\sigma\\cdot\\Omega. Noting that \\sigma\\cdot\\Omega^T = \\sigma^T\\cdot\\Omega , as can be verified with a simple calculation in a Cartesian coordinate setting, we see that (\\sigma - \\sigma^T)\\cdot\\Omega = 0. Since this is true for every skew-symmetry \\Omega , it follows that \\sigma = \\sigma^T. Thus, the requirement for the invariance of the first law of thermodynamics with respect to Eulidean observer transformation characterized by a rotation implies that the Cauchy stress tensor is symmetric. By looking at the implication of this result on a small cube centered at a point inside the continuum, we see that this states the fact that the net angular momentum of the cube is zero. For this reason, the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor is often called the balance of angular momentum equation. Remark A tacit assumtion that we have made throughout our discussion is that, unlike a body force density, there is body couple density . This fact turns out to be crucial in the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor. It is indeed possible to formulate continuum theories that do not make this assumption. One of the advantages of the approach we have adopted here is that it is straightforward to study such generalized continua using the principles presented here. Summary of the GNR theorem The Green-Naghdi-Rivlin theorem essentially states the equivalence between the balance principles of continuum mechanics, namely the mass conservation equation , \\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = 0, the linear momentum balance equation , \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\frac{D \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\text{div }\\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t), and the angular momentum balance equation , \\sigma = \\sigma^T, with the invariance of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\left(e(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)\\,dv &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv\\\\ &+ \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da\\\\ &+ \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv\\\\ &- \\int_{\\partial B_t} h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da,\\\\ \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\eta(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv \\ge \\int_{B_t} \\frac{\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)}\\,dv &- \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\frac{h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))}{\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)}\\,da, \\end{split} with respect to Euclidean observer transformations. This is a profound observation and is conceptually similar to the idea behind Noether's theorem in physics that shows that symmetries and conservation laws are essentially two sides of the same coin. Remark The approach taken to derive the balance principles for continua from the invariance of the laws of thermodynamics with respect to Euclidean observer transformations is admittedly more complex than the approach taken in typical engineering treatments of continuum mechanics. While the engineering approach is certainly easier to follows, the approach we have adopted is ultimately more powerful and provides more insight into the nature of the balance principles. Moreover, the derivation of balance principles for generalized continua, and/or other classes of space-time diffeomorphisms, say the one used in special relativity, is much more straightforward using the Green-Naghdi-Rivlin approach.","title":"Green-Naghdi-Rivlin theorem"},{"location":"gnr/#green-naghdi-rivlin-gnr-theorem","text":"We will now study a central theorem in continuum mechanics that illustrates how the principle of (Euclidean) relativity in conjunction with the laws of thermodnamics yields all the balance principles of continuum mechanics.

If two different observers, \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ , assign coordinates \\mathsf{x},t and \\mathsf{x}^+,t^+ , respectively, for the same event, then the map (\\mathsf{x},t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} \\to (\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} is called an observer transformation . Note that an observer transformation is a diffeomorphism of spacetime. This means that the map displayed above is continuously differentiable, and invertible, with the inverse also being continuously differentiable. Remark The reason for using the notation (\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) for the space and time coordinates for the second observer is simply to emphasize that we will shortly focus on a special class of observer transformations that can alternatively also be interpreted as a superimposed rigid body motion . Let us now focus on a special class of observer transformations, namely those that preserve the distance between two points in space, and the time interval between two events. To make this concrete, suppose that we consider two events, which have spacetime coordinates (\\mathsf{x}_1,t_1) and (\\mathsf{x}_2,t_2) according to observer \\mathcal{O} . Let the space and time coordinates of the same event with respect to another observer \\mathcal{O}^+ be (\\mathsf{x}_2^+,t_2^+) . The requirement that the two observers measure the same distance between these two points and record the same time interval between these two events can be expressed using the following equations: \\begin{split} \\lVert \\mathsf{x}_1 - \\mathsf{x}_2 \\rVert &= \\lVert \\mathsf{x}_1^+ - \\mathsf{x}_2^+ \\rVert,\\\\ t_1 - t_2 &= t_1^+ - t_2^+. \\end{split} A general class of observer transformations that satisfies this requirement can be written as \\begin{split} \\mathsf{x}^+(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\mathsf{c}(t) + \\mathsf{Q}(t)(\\mathsf{x} - \\mathsf{x}_0),\\\\ t^+(\\mathsf{x},t) &= t, \\end{split} as can be easily verified. Here, \\mathsf{c}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , \\mathsf{x}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , and \\mathsf{Q}(t) \\in SO(3) for every t \\in \\mathbb{R} . For the sake of notational succinctness, we will write \\mathsf{x}^+ and \\mathsf{t}^+ for \\mathsf{x}^+(\\mathsf{x},t) and t^+(\\mathsf{x},t) , respectively. Observer transformations of this form are called Euclidean transformations . In the special case when we insist that \\mathsf{c}(t) = \\mathsf{c}_0t for some constant vector \\mathsf{c}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , and \\mathsf{Q}(t) = \\mathsf{Q}_0 for some constant \\mathsf{Q}_0 \\in SO(3) , these observer transformations are called Galilean transformations . Remark In special relativity, one considers observers who agree upon the proper time interval between two events. Given two events with coordinates (\\mathsf{x}_1,t_1) and (\\mathsf{x}_2,t_2) according to an observer, the proper time interval between these two events is defined as \\Delta \\tau = c^2(t_1 - t_2)^2 - \\lVert \\mathsf{x}_1 - \\mathsf{x}_2\\rVert^2. Here, c \\in \\mathbb{R} stands for the velocity of light in vacuum. In special relativity, two consenting observers agree only upon the proper time interval. Notice that this does not require them to agree upon distances between two points in space, or the time time interval between two events, in sharp constrast to classical (Newtonian) physics. Galilean transformations are used in the classical principle of relativity: the laws of classical physics remain invariant with respect to Galilean transformations. In continuum mechanics, we will postulate the invariance of the continuum analogues of the first and second laws of thermodynamics with respect to Euclidean transformations. This is the key idea behind the Green-Naghdi-Rivlin theorem.","title":"Observer transformations"},{"location":"gnr/#objectivity","text":"We will now introduce a crucial concept called objectivity for scalar, vector and tensor fields.

In other words, the components fields of an objective vector field are objective scalar fields. The physical intuition behind this is that if a vector field is objective, then a Euclidean transformation just rotates the basis vectors of each tangent space uniformly , but doesn't affect the components of an objective vector field with respect to these bases. In other words, an objective vector field rotates along with the observer globally .","title":"Vector fields"},{"location":"gnr/#tensor-fields","text":"The objectivity of tensor fields is defined in a manner analogous to that of vector fields.

An analogous interpretation of the objectivity of tensor fields as in the case of vector fields should be evident. Owing to its practical utility, it is useful to consider the special case of a second order tensor field.

This can be easily verified by an explicit computation, and is left as a simple exercise. This form of the objectivity condition for second order tensors will be used extensively in the sequel. Remark To keep the notation manageable, we will often drop the arguments and write the objectivity condition for a second order tensor field as just \\mathsf{A}^+ = \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{Q}^T .","title":"Tensor fields"},{"location":"gnr/#objectivity-of-continuum-fields","text":"As should be clear now, we would ideally like the various scalar, vector and tensor fields that enter a continuum description of the first and second laws of thermodynamics need to be objective. The reason is that this enforces observer invariance of the various continuum fields involved. Let us now make this notion formally precise. As before, we will be dealing with two observers \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ who are related according to a Euclidean transformation. To begin with, we will postulate that all the scalar fields involved in the first and second laws of thermodynamics are objective. To be specific, we postulate the following relations: \\begin{split} \\rho^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) &= \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t),\\\\ e^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) &= e(\\mathsf{x},t),\\\\ r^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) &= r(\\mathsf{x},t),\\\\ \\eta^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) &= \\eta(\\mathsf{x},t),\\\\ \\theta^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) &= \\theta(\\mathsf{x},t),\\\\ h^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+,\\mathsf{n}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)) &= h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)). \\end{split} Notice how the unit normal figures in the last expression. Since a unit normal is an element of the appropriate tangent space, it transforms objectively: \\mathsf{n}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) . Let us now turn to the various vector fields that figure in the first law of thermodynamics. To start with, consider the simple case of a particle moving in three dimensional space such that at time t \\in I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} , the particle occupies position \\mathsf{x}(t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^3 , according to observer \\mathcal{O} . The velocity and acceleration of this particle, as observed by \\mathcal{O} are given by \\dot{\\mathsf{x}}(t) = d\\mathsf{x}(t)/dt and \\ddot{\\mathsf{x}}(t) = d^2\\mathsf{x}(t)/dt^2 , respectively. Let us now compute how the motion of the same particle according to an observer \\mathcal{O}^+ who is related to \\mathcal{O} by a general Euclidean transformation, \\mathsf{x}^+(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{c}(t) + \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{x}, \\qquad t^+ = t, looks like. The position, velocity and acceleration of the same particle as observed by \\mathcal{O}^+ can be easily computed as \\begin{split} \\mathsf{x}^+(t) &= \\mathsf{c}(t) + \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{x}(t),\\\\ \\mathsf{v}^+(t) &= \\dot{\\mathsf{c}}(t) + \\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}(t)\\mathsf{x}(t) + \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{v}(t),\\\\ \\mathsf{a}^+(t) &= \\ddot{\\mathsf{c}}(t) + \\ddot{\\mathsf{Q}}(t)\\mathsf{x}(t) + 2\\dot{\\mathsf{Q}}(t)\\mathsf{v}(t) + \\mathsf{Q}(t)\\mathsf{a}(t). \\end{split} Remark Notice the close similarity between the first equation in the list of three equations above, and the Euclidean transformation relation observers \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ . In the former, \\mathsf{x}(t) is a time dependent trajectory of a particle in three dimensional space. In the latter, \\mathsf{x} stands for a generic point in space, and has no time dependence at all. The meaning of equations like these should always be inferred carefully from the appropriate context. Note that neither the velocity, nor the acceleration of the particle, are objective vector fields in general. In the special case of a Galilean transformation, howevever, when \\mathsf{c}(t) = \\mathsf{c}_0 t for some constant \\mathsf{c}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , and when \\mathsf{Q}(t) = \\mathsf{Q}_0 for some constant rotation map \\mathsf{Q}_0 \\in SO(3) , we see that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{v}^+(t) &= \\mathsf{c}_0 + \\mathsf{Q}_0\\mathsf{v}(t),\\\\ \\mathsf{a}^+(t) &= \\mathsf{Q}_0\\mathsf{a}(t). \\end{split} We thus see that the velocity vector is still not objective, but the acceleration is in fact an objective vector. This is the familiar result in elementary classical physics that if two observers are moving relative to each other with a constant velocity, then they will measure the same acceleration of any moving body they observe, but disagree on the velocity. Let us now move on to the other vector fields appearing in the first law of thermodynamics. Let us look at the surface traction first. Recall that the traction vector was introducted to model the surface force on a continuum. Thus, given any small areal \\Delta a centered at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t with normal \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) , we modeled the force acting on this small area as \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\Delta a . We will now extend the traction defined on the surface \\partial B_t to the whole of B_t so that given any \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t and \\mathsf{n} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , we have uniquely defined vector \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . The idea behind this extension is that we can compute a force on every infinitesimal area at every point in the continuum, as shown in the following figure: We will take it as a basic postulate of continuum mechanics that this extension is always well-defined. The simplest means to appreciate this postulate is by going back to the spring mass analogy given earlier - any force applied on the surface atoms percolates to the interior as a consequence of the collective response of all the springs to the applied force. We are now in a position to state an important postulate: we will henceforth consider the traction vector field as being objective. This means that if two observers \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ who are related by a Euclidean transformation observe the same process, then \\mathsf{t}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+,\\mathsf{n}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)) = \\mathsf{Q}(t) \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)). To understand the rationale behind the postulate concerning the objectivity of the traction vector field, note that the traction vector represents the internal response of the continuum due to externally applied forces and energy supplied in the form of heat. Thus the postulate that the traction vector field is objective simply means that this internal response of the continuum is independent of observer transformations. Remark Another way of rationalizing this is to note that when viewed from the atomistic viewpoint, the energy of a collection of atoms, called an interatomic potential , can only depend on the relative positions of the atoms, and not on their absolute positions, if the energy is to describe a physically realistic internal energy that is invariant with respect to translations and rotations. Since Euclidean transformations do not change the relative positions of the atoms, it makes sense to postulate that the traction vector field is objective. Note that the need to make this a postulate is simply because the continuum is a mathematical construct, and the behavior of dynamical fields defined on the continuum need to be postulated based on the behavior of their true atomistic counterparts. Finally, let us turn to the body force density. Rather than talk about the body force density \\mathsf{b} directly, we will consider instead the quantity \\mathsf{b} - \\mathsf{a} , and postulate that this quantity is objective. Thus, from the point of view of two observers \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ who are related by a Euclidean transformation, we postulate that \\mathsf{b}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) - \\mathsf{a}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) = \\mathsf{Q}(t)(\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t)). Recall that we studied the transformation rules for the spatial accleration (which is not an objective vector field) earlier. Using that in conjunction with the equation presented above gives the observer transformation rule for the body force density. To understand the idea behind this postulate, it is helpful to consider a very simple system of a mass connected by a spring to a stationary point. Assuming the spring to be linear with a spring constant k , the equation governing the dynamics of the mass when subject to a force mb , according to observer \\mathcal{O} , is given by mb - k(x - x_0) = ma. Here, \\mathsf{x}_0 is the coordinate of the fixed point to which the spring is attached. The same equation takes the following form according to an observer \\mathcal{O}^+ who is related to \\mathcal{O} by a Euclidean transformation: mb^+ - k(x^+ - x_0^+) = ma^+. Using the fact that x^+ - x_0^+ = \\mathsf{Q}(t)(x - x_0) , it is easy to see that b^+ - a^+ = Q(b - a). This is just the transformation rule postulated earlier. While this does not prove the postulate (which is why it is a postulate in the first place), it provides a simple means to appreciate why the postulate is formulated in its specific form.","title":"Objectivity of continuum fields"},{"location":"gnr/#observer-invariance-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics","text":"We have now all the necessary tools to study the consequences of requiring that the first and second laws of thermodynamics are invariant with respect to Euclidean observer transformations. We will start with the second law of thermodynamics since it is much easier to deal with. Let \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ be two observers who are related by a Euclidean transformation. Let us write the second law according to the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ : \\frac{d}{dt^+}\\int_{B_t^+} \\rho^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) \\, dv^+ \\ge \\int_{B_t^+} \\frac{\\rho^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)r^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)}{\\theta^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)} \\, dv^+ - \\int_{\\partial B_t^+} \\frac{h^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+,\\mathsf{n}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+))}{\\theta^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)}\\,da^+. Let us now change the variables from (\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+) to (\\mathsf{x},t) . Since the second law involves only scalar fields, each of which is objective, the transformation of the integrands is trivial. The volume and area integrals transform according to the usual change of variables rules that we studied earlier. Specifically, note that for any scalar field f:B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} , \\begin{split} \\int_{B_t^+} f^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)\\eta^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)\\,dv^+ &= \\int_{B_t} f(\\mathsf{x},t) \\text{det}(\\mathsf{Q}(t))\\,dv\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. \\end{split} In deriving the last expression, we used the fact that \\mathsf{Q}(t) is orthogonal. To understand how area integrals transform, let us revisit the change of area formula in the case of a Euclidean observer transformation: \\mathsf{n}^+(\\mathsf{x}^+,t^+)\\Delta a^+ = \\text{det}(\\mathsf{Q}(t))\\mathsf{Q}^{-T}\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta a. Noting that \\mathsf{Q}^{-T}(t) = \\mathsf{Q}(t) and that \\mathsf{n}^+ = \\mathsf{Q}\\mathsf{n} , it follows that \\Delta a^+ = \\Delta a .

But this is precisely the second law as recorded by the observer \\mathcal{O} .

This remarkable result is known as the Green-Naghdi-Rivlin theorem . We will develop this in two stages: we will first study the consequences of requiring the first laws to be invariant with respect to observers who are moving relative to each other with a constant velocity, and subsequently with respect to observers who are rotating with respect to each other.","title":"Observer invariance of the first law of thermodynamics"},{"location":"gnr/#mass-and-linear-momentum-balance","text":"Let us first consider the case when the observers \\mathcal{O} and \\mathcal{O}^+ are related to each other according to the following transformation: \\mathsf{x}^+ = \\mathsf{x} + \\mathsf{c}_0 t, \\quad t^+ = t.

Note also that \\mathsf{Q}(t) = \\mathsf{I} in this case.

Since this equation and the transformed equation of the first law according to the observer \\mathcal{O}^+ that we presented earlier, we immediately get the following equation: \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho\\left(\\mathsf{v}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{c}_0\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\right)dv = \\int_{B_t} \\mathsf{b}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,da. Since this equation is true for arbitrary \\mathsf{c}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , writing the same equation for -\\mathsf{c}_0 and adding the two equations, we get \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{c}_0\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho\\,dv = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = 0. We thus see that the total mass contained in the region B_t is conserved. But this is precisely the law of conservation of mass. Taking the time derivative inside the integral, we see that \\int_{B_t} \\left(\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\rho\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}\\right) = 0. Using the localization lemma, we get the familiar mass continuity equation \\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = 0. Notice how the simple requirement that the first law of thermodynamics is invariant with respect to observers moving relative to each other with a constant velocity has already yielded the mass conservation equation! We're not done yet. Using the mass continuity equation in conjunction with the Reynolds' transport theorem, we see that, for any arbitray \\mathsf{c}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 , \\int_{B_t} \\rho \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}}{Dt}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\mathsf{b}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,da. Note that we cannot directly localize this integral equation on account of the surface integral. Let us now look into this; in the process we will develop a crucial notion in continuum mechanics, that of the stress tensor . The kernel of the surface term \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0 is a function of \\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n} . The Cauchy localization lemma immediately implies the existence of a vector field \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0} on B_t such that \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0 = \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t), for every \\mathsf{c}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 . To understand how the vector field \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0} depends on \\mathsf{c}_0 , consider any arbitrary \\mathsf{c}_0,\\mathsf{c}_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 and a \\in \\mathbb{R} , and note that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0 + a\\mathsf{c}_1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot(\\mathsf{c}_0 + a\\mathsf{c}_1)\\\\ &= \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0 + a \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_1\\\\ &= \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) + a\\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t). \\end{split} We thus see that \\mathcal{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0} is a linear function of \\mathsf{c}_0 . This implies that there exists a linear map \\sigma(\\mathsf{x}, t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t such that \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sigma^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{c}_0. Remark Note that if \\sigma is a linear map, so is \\sigma^T . The reason for using the transpose of \\sigma in the equation \\mathsf{t}_{\\mathsf{c}_0}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sigma^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{c}_0 is primarily a matter of convention so that the components of \\sigma with respect to a chosen basis has the familiar interpretation used in engineering. Remark Note that the Cauchy localization lemma only shows the existence of a linear map of the form \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 . However, in our case, since B_t is an open subset of \\mathbb{R}^3 , we have the natural identity T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\equiv T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 . The reason for preferring T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t over T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 will become evident soon. The linear map, or equivalently, the second order tensor, \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) is called the Cauchy stress tensor . With this definition, we see that for every \\mathsf{c},\\mathsf{n} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n})\\cdot\\mathsf{c} = \\sigma^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{c} \\cdot \\mathsf{n} = \\mathsf{c} \\cdot \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{n}. Since this is true for every \\mathsf{c} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , we obtain the following expression relating the traction vector and the Cauchy stress tensor: \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) = \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{n}. This equation tells us that the Cauchy stress tensor allows us to compute the surface force acting on any infinitesimal area with a prescribed unit normal. To understand what the Cauchy stress tensor means, let us consider the component representation of the equation \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) = \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{n} with respect to an orthonormal basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) of T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t : t_i(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) = \\sum \\sigma_{ij}(\\mathsf{x},t) n_j, where \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sum \\sigma_{ij}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_j is the coordinate representation of the Cauchy stress tensor. To physically interpret the components of the Cauchy stress tensor, consider a cube with one of its vertices at \\mathsf{x}\\in B_t as shown below: We thus see that \\sigma_{ij}(\\mathsf{x},t) represents the force along the i^{\\text{th}} coordinate axis on an infinitesimal area element at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t whose normal is along the j^{\\text{th}} coordinate axis. Returning back to our discussion of the invariance of the first law of thermodynamics with respect to Euclidean observer transformations, let us use the Cauchy stress tensor to localize the equation \\int_{B_t} \\rho \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}}{Dt}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\mathsf{b}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,da. Using the fact that \\mathsf{t} = \\sigma\\mathsf{n} and using the divergence theorem, we see that \\begin{split} \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0 \\,da &= \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{c}_0 \\cdot \\sigma \\mathsf{n}\\,da\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\text{div}(\\mathsf{c}_0\\cdot\\sigma)\\,dv. \\end{split} Using this result, and the fact that \\mathsf{c}_0 is a constant vector, we obtain the following integral relation: \\int_{B_t} \\left(\\rho\\frac{D\\mathsf{v}}{Dt} - \\mathsf{b} - \\text{div }\\sigma\\right)\\cdot\\mathsf{c}_0\\,dv = 0. The localization lemma immediately yields the following differential equation: \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\frac{D\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\text{div }\\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t). This equation is the continuum analogue of Newton's second laws ma = F , and is hence called the linear momentum balance equation. The means to understand this physically is as follows. As a consequence of the application of external forces (both body forces and surface tractions), the continuum responds by generating generalized internal forces , which we have modeled using the Cauchy stress tensor. The term \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\text{div }\\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) thus represents the net force acting at an interior point \\mathsf{x}\\in B_t . This net force is equal to its acceleration \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) . We have thus obtained both the balance of mass and balance of linear momentum from the first law of thermodynamics by merely insisting that the first law is invariant with respect to two observers who are in relative motion with respect to each other with a constant velocity!","title":"Mass and linear momentum balance"},{"location":"gnr/#angular-momentum-balance","text":"In the previous section, we obtained both the mass and linear momentum conservation equations as a consequence of the invariance of the first law of thermodynamics with respect to Euclidean transformations characterized by a constant velocity relative motion of the observers.

Let us now express the surface traction in terms of the Cauchy stress tensor, and the divergence theorem, to transform the surface integral in the right hand side into a volume integral as follows: \\begin{split} \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{a} - \\mathsf{b})\\cdot\\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\,dv &= \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\sigma\\mathsf{n}\\,da\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\text{div }(\\Omega \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\sigma)\\,dv. \\end{split} To proceed further, let us simplify the expression \\text{div }(\\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\sigma) . It is helpful to temporarily adopt a Cartesian coordinate system for this purpose: \\begin{split} \\text{div }(\\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\sigma) &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}(\\Omega_{ik}x_k\\sigma_{ij})\\\\ &= \\sum \\Omega_{ij}\\sigma_{ij} + \\sum W_{ik}x_k\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j}\\\\ &= \\sigma \\cdot \\Omega + \\Omega \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\text{div }\\sigma. \\end{split} Using this in the result, we see that \\int_{B_t} \\Omega\\mathsf{x}\\cdot(\\rho\\mathsf{a} - \\rho\\mathsf{b} - \\text{div }\\sigma)\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\sigma \\cdot \\Omega \\,dv. The term on the left hand side of this equation vanishes on account of the balance of linear momentum that was discussed earlier. We thus arrive at the following equation: \\int_{B_t} \\sigma \\cdot \\Omega\\, dv = 0. The localization principle immediately yields the relation \\sigma \\cdot \\Omega = 0, for every skew-symmetric map \\Omega . Noting that the skew-symmetry of \\Omega permits us to write \\Omega = (\\Omega - \\Omega^T)/2 , we see that 0 = \\sigma \\cdot \\Omega = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma \\cdot (\\Omega - \\Omega^T), and hence that \\sigma\\cdot\\Omega^T = \\sigma\\cdot\\Omega. Noting that \\sigma\\cdot\\Omega^T = \\sigma^T\\cdot\\Omega , as can be verified with a simple calculation in a Cartesian coordinate setting, we see that (\\sigma - \\sigma^T)\\cdot\\Omega = 0. Since this is true for every skew-symmetry \\Omega , it follows that \\sigma = \\sigma^T. Thus, the requirement for the invariance of the first law of thermodynamics with respect to Eulidean observer transformation characterized by a rotation implies that the Cauchy stress tensor is symmetric. By looking at the implication of this result on a small cube centered at a point inside the continuum, we see that this states the fact that the net angular momentum of the cube is zero. For this reason, the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor is often called the balance of angular momentum equation. Remark A tacit assumtion that we have made throughout our discussion is that, unlike a body force density, there is body couple density . This fact turns out to be crucial in the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor. It is indeed possible to formulate continuum theories that do not make this assumption. One of the advantages of the approach we have adopted here is that it is straightforward to study such generalized continua using the principles presented here.","title":"Angular momentum balance"},{"location":"gnr/#summary-of-the-gnr-theorem","text":"The Green-Naghdi-Rivlin theorem essentially states the equivalence between the balance principles of continuum mechanics, namely the mass conservation equation , \\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = 0, the linear momentum balance equation , \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\frac{D \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\text{div }\\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t), and the angular momentum balance equation , \\sigma = \\sigma^T, with the invariance of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\left(e(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)\\,dv &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv\\\\ &+ \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da\\\\ &+ \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv\\\\ &- \\int_{\\partial B_t} h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da,\\\\ \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\eta(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv \\ge \\int_{B_t} \\frac{\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)}\\,dv &- \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\frac{h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))}{\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)}\\,da, \\end{split} with respect to Euclidean observer transformations. This is a profound observation and is conceptually similar to the idea behind Noether's theorem in physics that shows that symmetries and conservation laws are essentially two sides of the same coin. Remark The approach taken to derive the balance principles for continua from the invariance of the laws of thermodynamics with respect to Euclidean observer transformations is admittedly more complex than the approach taken in typical engineering treatments of continuum mechanics. While the engineering approach is certainly easier to follows, the approach we have adopted is ultimately more powerful and provides more insight into the nature of the balance principles. Moreover, the derivation of balance principles for generalized continua, and/or other classes of space-time diffeomorphisms, say the one used in special relativity, is much more straightforward using the Green-Naghdi-Rivlin approach.","title":"Summary of the GNR theorem"},{"location":"intro/","text":"Overview and course contents Introduction Welcome to AE 639: Continuum Mechanics ! In this course, we will learn the basic principles related to modeling the mechanical behavior of continua. These notes assume a prior background in linear algebra and Euclidean tensor analysis; an introduction to the relevant topics may be found here . About Continuum Mechanics \"...researchers in elasticity theory are very opinionated, even when they are wrong. During our own work in this field we have refused to fight, and in keeping with this pacifist approach, we now issue these general disclaimers: This book is neither complete nor unbiased.\" (Marsden, Hughes: Mathematical Foundations of Elasticity) As the above quote suggests, continuum mechanics has a rich legacy of researchers with very strong opinions. In this course, I will carefully sidestep all polemics and instead focus on providing a broad introduction to continuum mechanics using ideas which are fairly established now. Nevertheless, it is inescapable that some of my own perspectives and choice of emphasis shows up at places. After finishing this course, you will be better placed to dive deeper into the literature and forge your own perspective, if you choose to do so. \"Rational\" Thermodynamics A very popular school of thought in continuum mechanics is the so-called rational thermodynamics school initiated by Clifford Truesdell and his students/associates. Despite the many excellent contributions from members of this school of thought and their crucial role in giving concrete shape to continuum mechanics as we know it today, I will carefully avoid using strong adjectives like rational in describing one particular school of thought since this has an obviously condescending and dismissive attitude towards other perspectives which are also equally, if not more, rational. When necessary, I will refer to what is conventionally called rational thermodynamics as Truesdellian thermodynamics . This choice of name is not to belittle contributions of other excellent researchers from this school - it merely highlights the fact that Truesdell was one of its most vocal proponents. Why study Continuum Mechanics? The primary objective of continuum mechanics (and continuum thermodynamics) is to provide a mathematical framework to analyze the behavior of materials at macroscopic length, time and energy scales, when they are subject to external forces and/or energy inputs in the form of heat. We will focus exclusively on the thermomechanical response of solids though a similar development can be effected for the study of continuum phenomena involving other fields like electric and magnetic fields. Continuum hypothesis Fundamental to continuum mechanics is the notion of a continuum . When dealing with materials at the macroscopic scale, we rarely think of them as a collection of atoms. Rather, we intuitively think of it as a substance that fills up the space it occupies. This is essentially what is known as the continuum hypothesis , and this imaginary substance which fills up the space a material occupies is called a continuum . This is best viewed as an idealization of the actual material behavior when dealing with macroscopic length and time scales. Indeed, it is possible to show how the continuum hypothesis is consistent, in an appropriately defined limiting sense, with the fundamental laws of physics. A detailed consideration of these ideas is beyond the scope of this course - the companion course AE 731: Multiscale Modeling of Materials will provide more details on this. As a qualitative justification of the continuum hypothesis we may think of the following thought experiment. We know that matter, both solid and fluid, is discrete and constituted of atoms at the nanometer length scale. Let us consider a caricature of this as shown in the figure below. We now consider imaginary disks, shown as filled grey circles in the picture above, of larger and larger radii and compute the number density of atoms inside these disks. A qualitative plot of the number density of atoms as function of the disk radius is shown below - note that the scale of the X axis is logarithmic. (This plot is adapted from G.K. Batchelor's An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics .) We see that the number density variation exhibits three distinct regimes. For disk radii of the order of nanometers (the typical interatomic spacing $a$ is of the order of a few Angstroms) or below there are large fluctuations. For intermediate length scales larger than the typical atomic length scale and below the typical macroscopic length scales, the number density variation is essentially constant. For macroscopic length scales, we begin to see large wavelength fluctuations of the number density. The key abstraction that we make in continuum mechanics is to ignore the microscopic fluctuations and focus instead entirely on the second and third regimes mentioned above. When we restrict ourselves to these regimes, we may as well introduce an imaginary substance called a continuum that fills up the whole of the space that the body occupies and associated with it a density field that agrees with the aforementioned figure in the continuum regimes. This abstraction is called the continuum hypothesis , and is qualitatively illustrated in the figure below. Mathematically, the shift in perspective can be illustrated as follows: viewed from the atomic perspective, we need to know the positions of the individual atoms $(q_i)_{i=1}^N \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3N}$ to describe the actual configuration of the body. However, when $N$ is very large (typically larger than Avogadro's number $\\sim 10^{23}$) it is more convenient to describe the body by the region $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3$ that it occupies and denote a particular point in the body as $x \\in B$. Whereas physical properties are described in the atomic perspective as functions of the phase space $\\Gamma \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{3N}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{3N}$ that collects the positions and momenta of the constituent atoms, physical quantities are represented as fields defined on the body $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3$. For instance, the mass density is defined as a function of the form $\\rho:B \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that associates with each $x \\in B$ the mass density $\\rho(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Continuum mechanics deals exclusively with this field representation, without any reference to the lower scale atomistic representation. Note: A natural question that may arise is the relationshipe between these two representations. Such questions, while of both conceptual importance and of practical importance in analyzing molecular simulations, will not be discussed in this course. You are welcome to attend the companion course AE 731 - Multiscale Modeling of Materials to learn more about these connections. Truesdellian perspective on continuum mechanics Some proponents of the Truesdellian school of continuum mechanics postulate the existence of a continuum, by fiat , and argue against the necessity for an elaborate microscopic justification of the notion of a continuum and the laws of continuum mechanics. Key meta-modeling assumptions In this course, we will develop continuum mechanics as a sub-branch of thermodynamics. We will do so in a manner that respects certain fundamental invariance principles that are cherished across all branches of physics. We will emphasize on two aspects in particular: Observer invariance, a.k.a objectivity , and Coordinate system invariance (for a given observer). The more fundamental of the two, namely objectivity, requires that the different observers, who are mutually related in some precisely defined sense, agree upon the basic physical behavior of the system under investigation. This is largely just a restricted version of Einstein's relativity principle, but we will see that there are certain additional features that come into play because of the presence of physical variables, like stress, that are specific to continuum mechanics. The second aspect is invariance of the physical laws, for a given observer, with respect to change of coordinate systems. This is easily accomplished by adopting a coordinate-free language that is provided by a branch of mathematics known as tensor analysis . A broad summary of this entire course is the systematic application of these two principles to the laws of thermodynamics, and to any postulated material behavior, in a manner that helps us understand the behavior of continua in a reasonably precise manner. Outline We will commence with a purely kinematical description of continua, by which we mean an understanding of the geometry of bodies and descriptions of their changes of shape. We will also discuss the structure of Newtonian spacetime briefly as part of this discussion to set the stage where our story unfolds. We will subsequently study the balance principles related to mass, momentum, energy, and entropy, using a celebrated result known as the Green-Naghdi-Rivlin theorem . All these considerations are universal in the sense that they apply to the thermomechanics of any continua. We bring in material specificity with the introduction of constitutive laws that detail how particular materials behave to external stimuli.

Despite the many excellent contributions from members of this school of thought and their crucial role in giving concrete shape to continuum mechanics as we know it today, I will carefully avoid using strong adjectives like rational in describing one particular school of thought since this has an obviously condescending and dismissive attitude towards other perspectives which are also equally, if not more, rational. When necessary, I will refer to what is conventionally called rational thermodynamics as Truesdellian thermodynamics .

In particular, we will see that all the information relevant to the change in shape of the body from the initial instant of time to the current instant of time is contained in a quantity called the deformation gradient . Deformation Let us consider, as before, a motion (\\chi_t)_{t \\in I} of a body \\mathcal{B} as it moves and deforms in the three dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^3 . Since it is much easier to deal with maps between open subsets of Euclidean spaces, our attention henceforth will almost exclusively be on the deformation map \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t , where B_0 = \\chi_0(\\mathcal{B}) and B_t = \\chi_t(\\mathcal{B}) are the initial and current placements of the body, respectively. Remark Before we proceed further, we will introduce a useful notational convention that will turn out to quite useful in the sequel. We will, for the most part, use uppercase symbols for quantities associated with the initial configuration, and lowercase symbols for quantities associated with the current configuration. This also includes the indices for components of vectors and tensors with respect to suitably chosen bases. Let us now introduce a basis for the three dimensional Euclidean space \\mathbb{R}^3 . For the sake of conceptual clarity, let us introduce two sets of bases (\\mathsf{E}_I)_{I=1}^3 and (\\mathsf{e}_i)_{i=1}^3 ; note that these are the bases chosen by a single observer. We will use the basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) to denote points in B_0 and the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) to denote points in B_t . Notice how we have used uppercase and lowercase symbols for the initial and current placements, according the convention just outlined. Remark For all practical purposes, we can identify the bases (\\mathsf{E}_I) and (\\mathsf{e}_i) of \\mathbb{R}^3 . A formal way to express this equivalence is using the equation \\mathsf{e}_i = \\sum \\delta_{iI} \\mathsf{E}_I . More generally, the bases could be related via an orthogonal matrix as follows: \\mathsf{e}_i = \\sum \\hat{Q}_{iJ} \\mathsf{E}_J , with the matrix [\\hat{\\mathsf{Q}}] whose (i,J)^{\\text{th}} entry is \\hat{Q}_{iJ} being orthogonal. Even though it is sufficient to identify the two bases for the following development, we will retain the upper and lower case notations for the purpose of conceptual clarity. Note In a more general development of continuum mechanics, the background space is itself modeled as a manifold. Since a manifold is, in general, not a linear space, the choice of a basis for space doesn't make sense in the general development. Rather, coordinates are assigned to every point on the manifold by the choice of an appropriate coordinate system. The choice of the two bases for \\mathbb{R}^3 as we have done here can be understood as the choice of two Cartesian coordinate systems, one for B_0 , and another for B_t . With this background, let us work out the coordinate representations of the deformation map. If (x_i) and (X_I) are the Cartesian coordinates of the points \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , respectively, the deformation map \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X}, t) can be written in coordinate form as follows: x_i = \\varphi_i(X_1, X_2, X_3, t), \\quad i = 1,2,3. Here \\varphi_i(\\cdot, t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R} are the component maps of \\varphi(\\cdot,t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 . We will often write this equation as x_i = \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t) . Example Consider the following deformation: x_1 = \\lambda_1 X_1, \\quad x_2 = \\lambda_2 X_2, \\quad x_3 = \\lambda_3 X_3, with \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 > 0 . This corresponds to a volumetric strain . To understand why this is the case, note that a cube of side length 1 gets transformed to a cuboid of side lengths \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 as a consequence of this deformation. Example As another example of an elementary deformation, let us consider the following: x_1 = X_1 + X_2 \\tan \\theta, \\quad x_2 = X_2, \\quad x_3 = X_3. This is an example of a pure shear . Deformation gradient We now turn to the critical notion of the deformation gradient . As remarked earlier, this quantity carries all the information that is required to characterize the deformation of the body. But in its essence, it is a very simple idea. Note that the deformation map \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t is a nonlinear function of \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . Recall that the preferred means to study general nonlinear maps is to construct their local linearized version, and study this linearized map locally. This, in particular, involves the computation of the Frechet derivative of the nonlinear map. The Frechet derivative of the deformation map is called the deformation gradient . We will use the fact that when the Frechet derivative exists, it is identical to the Gateaux derivative, and use the latter to derive the expression for the deformation gradient. At any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , choose an arbitrary vector \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 in the tangent space to B_0 at \\mathsf{X} . Consider the line \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}:[0,\\delta] \\to B_0 defined as follows: for any s \\in [0,\\delta] , \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s) = \\mathsf{X} + s\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. Since B_0 is open, it is always possible to choose an appropriate value of \\delta > 0 so as to ensure that the image of this line lies entirely in B_0 . In the limit when \\delta \\to 0 , the material curve \\chi_0^{-1} \\circ \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}:[0,\\delta] \\to \\mathcal{B} is called an infinitesimal material line segment . It follows from a simple calculation that \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s) = \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. This just expresses the fact that the tangent vector to the curve \\bar{\\mathsf{X}} at \\mathsf{X} is \\Delta\\mathsf{X} . As a consequence of the deformation, the line \\bar{\\mathsf{X}} gets deformed to the line \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}:[0,\\delta] \\to B_t , where, for any s \\in [0,\\delta] , \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}(s) = \\varphi_t(\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s)). We will use the notation \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t to denote the tangent vector to the deformed curve \\bar{\\mathsf{x}} at \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) . We will now define the deformation gradient at \\mathsf{X} as the map \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t that maps the tangent vector \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 to the tangent vector \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_t : \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. To compute the expression for the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) in terms of the deformation map, note that \\begin{split} \\Delta \\mathsf{x} &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}(s)\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\varphi_t(\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s))\\\\ &= \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s)\\\\ &= \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. \\end{split} For reasons that will become clear later on, we will introduce a new notation: \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\text{GRAD } \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. Remark Notice that we dropped the generalized dot product in \\nabla\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{X} in writing it as \\text{GRAD }\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})\\Delta\\mathsf{X} . This is to due to the fact that the deformation gradient is actually the Frechet derivative of the deformation map. As long as we are working in Euclidean spaces, this distinction isn't really important. We will therefore write the action of the deformation map \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) on \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as follows: \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\text{GRAD } \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\Delta\\mathsf{X}. Since the deformationg gradient maps tangent vectors to curves in the initial placement to tangent vectors to curves in the current placement, it is also called as the tangent map of the deformation. Remark The symbol \\text{GRAD }\\cdot stands for the gradient operation with respect to the coordinate system chosen on B_0 . The uppercase notation is chosen to be consistent with the notational convention we chose earlier. Let us work out the coordinate representation of the deformation gradient. Since we are working within a Cartesian coordinate setting, we can choose the same basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) for all the tangent spaces of B_0 , and the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) for all the tangent spaces of B_t . If \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\sum \\Delta x_i \\mathsf{e}_i, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\sum \\Delta X_I \\mathsf{E}_I, then it follows from a straightforward calculation that \\Delta x_i = \\sum F_{iI}\\Delta X_I = \\sum \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_I} \\Delta X_I. The coordinate representation of the deformation gradient follows immediately as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, where F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}. We will at times use the shorthand notation F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\varphi_{i,J}(\\mathsf{X},t) to write this equation. Note that the components of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) can be arranged into a matrix [\\mathsf{F}] whose (i,J)^{\\text{th}} entry is F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) . In terms of this matrix, we see that \\begin{bmatrix} \\Delta x_1\\\\ \\Delta x_2\\\\ \\Delta x_3\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} F_{11} & F_{12} & F_{13}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22} & F_{23}\\\\ F_{31} & F_{32} & F_{33} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\Delta X_1\\\\ \\Delta X_2\\\\ \\Delta X_3\\end{bmatrix}, or, in a much more concise form, [\\Delta \\mathsf{x}] = [\\mathsf{F}][\\Delta\\mathsf{X}] . Let us quickly look into the physical meaning of the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . Suppose that \\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{X}' \\in B_0 are two neighboring points, and let \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{X}' - \\mathsf{X} . Let the corresponding points in the current placement be \\mathsf{x}, \\mathsf{x}' \\in B_t , and let \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{x} - \\mathsf{x}' . In the limit when the line joining \\mathsf{X} and \\mathsf{X}' in B_0 corresponds to an infinitesimal material line segment in \\mathcal{B} , it follows from a simple application of Taylor's theorem that \\begin{split} x'_i &= \\varphi_i(X'_1, X'_2, X'_3, t)\\\\ &= \\varphi_i(X_1 + \\Delta X_1, X_2 + \\Delta X_2, X_3 + \\Delta X_3, t)\\\\ &= \\varphi_i(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) + \\sum \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(X_1,X_2,X_3,t)}{\\partial X_I} \\Delta X_I + o(\\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X}\\rVert^2). \\end{split} Rearranging this, we see that \\Delta x_i \\simeq \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta X_I. The deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) thus tells us how two neighboring points in the initial placement get relatively deformed as a consequence of the deformation. Remark In the derivation above, o(\\cdot) stands for the little 'o' symbol. This is defined as follows: given functions f, g:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} , we say that f = o(g) at x_* \\in \\mathbb{R} if it is true that \\lim_{x \\to x_*} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0. The extension to higher dimensional functions is similarly defined. Let us know revisit the examples we studied in the previous section and compute their deformation gradient Example For the case of a volumetric strain deformation with x_1 = \\lambda_1 X_1 , x_2 = \\lambda_2 X_2 and x_3 = \\lambda_3 X_3 , it follows from a simple computation that F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum \\lambda_i \\delta_{iJ} \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. In matrix form, [\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)] = \\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{bmatrix}. It is a good idea to relate this deformation gradient to the effect the volumetric strain deformation has on a unit cube. Example Let us consider the example of pure shear, with x_1 = X_1 + \\tan \\theta X_2 , x_2 = X_2 and x_3 = X_3 . It follows from a straightforward calculation that [\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, where s = \\tan \\theta denotes the amount of shear. Note that the deformation gradient can be equivalenlty written as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{I} + s \\mathsf{e}_1 \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_2. Here, \\mathsf{I}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t is the identity map that maps the basis (E_I) of T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 to the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) of T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . In practice, we will often have a few other restrictions on the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . In particular, we will always assume that the deformation gradient is invertible. This implies, in particular that the determinant of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) is non-zero. We will, in fact, show shortly that for physically admissible deformations, \\text{det}(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)) > 0 . We will therefore assume in the sequel the existence of the inverse deformation map \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Length transformation Let us now see how the length of an infinitesimal line element changes as a consequence of deformation. In what follows, we will identify, as in the preceeding discussions, an infinitesimal line element with an element of the appropriate tangent space. Thus, suppose that the vector \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is mapped to \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t by the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . It follows from a simple calculation that \\begin{split} \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x}\\rVert^2 &= \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= (\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot (\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X})\\\\ &= \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}, \\end{split} where \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t) . Note that \\mathsf{F}^T:T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . We now introduce the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t). Remark Many engineering textbooks write the foregoing equation as \\mathsf{C} = \\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} . We will adopt such a simplified notation when it suits our needs. But it should always be kept in mind what such shorthand notations actually mean. In terms of the bases (\\mathsf{E}_I) and (\\mathsf{e}_i) of the respective tangent spaces, it follows from a simple calculation that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i,\\\\ \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. \\end{split} Remark It is instructive to pause here and reflect on the mathematical difference between the quantities \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Both these are linear maps, and can be converted into tensors on the product spaces T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\otimes T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\otimes T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , respectively. Notice how the definition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) involves two distinct vector spaces, while \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) depends only on one vector space. For this reason, \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called a two-point tensor , while \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) is a tensor in the usual sense of the term as we studied earlier. Returning to our discussion of the change in the length of an infinitesimal line segment as a consequence of deformation, it follows from the developments so far that \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 = \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\left(\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}, where \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Introducing the Green-Lagrange strain tensor , also called the Lagrangian strain tensor , \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right), we see that the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment can be expressed in terms of the Lagrangian strain tensor as \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 = 2\\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. We thus see that the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment is dictated by the Lagrangian strain tensor. In terms of the basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) of T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , it is straightfoward to verify that \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, \\qquad E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(C_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\delta_{IJ}\\right). Here, C_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) are the components of the right Cauchy-Green tensor, and \\delta_{IJ} is the Kronecker delta symbol. The diagonal component fields E_{II}(\\mathsf{X},t) are called axial , or tensile strains, while the off-diagonal component fields E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) , with I \\neq J are called shear strains. The preceeding discussion allowed us to study the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment in the Lagrangian description. Alternatively, we can describe the same phenomena from the Eulerian viewpoint. Following the same line of thought as above, we see that \\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. Defining the left Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t), where \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) , it follows that \\begin{split} \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X} &= \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{b}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. \\end{split} The Eulerian strain tensor , also called the Almansi strain tensor , is the map \\mathsf{e}:T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t defined as follows: \\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right). Here, \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . Using these definitions, we can now compute the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment in the Eulerian description as follows: \\begin{split} \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 &= \\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{x} - \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{b}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= 2\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. \\end{split} It is important to note the following identity: \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2\\right) = \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. Thus, the same physical phenomena can be expressed in two complementary viewpoints. It is however important to develop concrete relations like the one above that express the mutual compatibility of such distinct but equivalent descriptions. Example We would intuitively expect a body undergoing a pure translation or a pure rotation to have zero strain since the relative positions of the body do not change under these kinds of deformations. Let us verify this. Suppose that we are given a deformation \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t of the following form: for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) = \\mathsf{c} + \\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X} - \\mathsf{O}), where \\mathsf{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is a constant vector, and \\mathsf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is some fixed point in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Further, we will assume that the constant map \\mathsf{Q}:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 is orthogonal. With these assumptions, it is clear that this denotes a deformation consisting of a rotation according to the rotation map \\mathsf{Q} about the point \\mathsf{O} followed by a uniform translation \\mathsf{c} . It is left as a straightforward exercise to compute that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{Q}, and, consequently, that \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{0} , and \\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{0} . We thus see that the definition of strain that we have developed is consistent with our intuitive sense of how a strain ought to behave. Once we know how an infinitesimal line element changes in length as a consequence of deformation, the change in length of an arbitrary curve in the initial placement can be computed. Specifically, suppose that \\gamma:I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} \\to B_0 is a curve in B_0 . The length of this curve, L_\\gamma is computed as follows: L_{\\gamma} = \\int_I \\lVert D\\gamma(t)\\rVert dt. Remark It is not difficult to show that the length thus defined is independent of the parametrization of the curve. Indeed, suppose that there exists a smooth, monotonically increasing and surjective function \\tau:I \\to J \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} such that we can formulate an alternative parametrization of the line \\gamma(I) as the curve \\tilde{\\gamma}:J \\to B_0 as follows: \\tilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma \\circ \\tau^{-1} . Let \\tilde{L}_\\gamma denote the length of the curve \\tilde\\gamma ; we expect, based on the fact that \\gamma(I) = \\tilde{\\gamma}(J) that \\tilde{L}_\\gamma = L_\\gamma . Let us verify this: \\begin{split} L_\\gamma &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\gamma(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D(\\tilde\\gamma \\circ \\tau)(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\tilde\\gamma(\\tau(t))\\rVert D\\tau(t) dt\\\\ &= \\int_J \\lVert D\\tilde\\gamma(s) \\rVert ds\\\\ &= \\tilde{L}_\\gamma. \\end{split} In deriving this equation, use has been made of the fact that D\\tau(t) > 0 for every t \\in I . We now wish to find the length l_{\\gamma} of the deformed curve \\varphi_t \\circ \\gamma: I \\to B_t . This follows at once from the following calculation: \\begin{split} l_\\gamma &= \\int_I \\lVert D(\\varphi_t \\circ \\gamma)(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\varphi(\\gamma(t), t) D\\gamma(t)\\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\sqrt{\\mathsf{F}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t)} \\,dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\sqrt{D\\gamma(t) \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t)} \\,dt. \\end{split} We thus see that a knowledge of the deformation gradient allows us to compute the lengths of any curve in the initial placement. Volume transformation Let us now study how a volume of space occupied by the body at the initial time changes as a consequence of the deformation. Towards that end, we will first find out how an infinitesimal volume transforms as a consequence of deformation, and use this information to compute the change in volume of an arbitray initial volume. Consider three curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3:[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon] \\to B_0 such that \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(0) = \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(0) = \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(0) = \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . Let us consider the scalar triple product \\Delta V = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(s) \\times \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(s) of the tangent vectors to these curves at \\mathsf{X} . We will implicitly assume that the tangent vectors to the chosen curves at \\mathsf{X} are non-collinear. The scalar triple product \\Delta V is called an infinitesimal volume element . Note that that \\Delta V \\in \\mathbb{R} . We wish to study how the scalar triple product, \\Delta v \\in \\mathbb{R} , of the tangents corresponding deformed curves, \\hat{x}_i = \\varphi_t \\circ \\hat{X}_i:[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon] \\to B_t , i = 1,2,3 , at \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\in B_t is related to \\Delta V . This relationship is easily computed: \\begin{split} \\Delta v &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{x}}_1(s) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{x}}_2(s) \\times \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{x}}_3(s)\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\varphi_t \\circ \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\varphi_t \\circ \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(s) \\times \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\varphi_t \\circ \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(s)\\\\ &= \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(s) \\times \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(s)\\\\ &= \\text{det}(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t))\\,\\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(s) \\times \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(s)\\\\ &= \\text{det}(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t))\\,\\Delta V. \\end{split} In deriving this expression, we have made use of the chain rule of differentiation, and the definition of the determinant of a linear map in terms of volume forms. Introducing the Jacobian J(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\text{det}(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)), we can succinctly write the transformation rule for infinitesimal volume elements as follows: \\Delta v = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta V. Again, notice how a knowledge of the deformation gradient is sufficient to compute how volumes transform. If \\Omega \\subseteq B_0 is some sub-region of B_0 , we can compute the volume V_\\Omega occupied by the region \\Omega using the integral V_\\Omega = \\int_\\Omega dV. Here the integral is to be understood as the standard triple integral used to compute volumes in \\mathbb{R}^3 . As a consequence of deformation, the region \\Omega gets transformed to \\varphi_t(\\Omega) \\subseteq B_t . The volume v_\\Omega of this deformed region can be computed as v_\\Omega = \\int_{\\varphi_t(\\Omega)} dv. Employing the standard change of variables rules for integration, we can transform this volume integral over \\varphi_t(\\Omega) to an integral over \\Omega : v_\\Omega = \\int_\\Omega J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, dV. Notice the similarity between this and the transformation rule for infinitesimal volumes derived eariler. Area transformation Finally, let us consider how infinitesimal area elements transform as a consequence of deformation. The starting point is the volume transformation rule that we studied earlier. Suppose that we have three curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3:[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon] \\to B_0 such that \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(0) = \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(0) = \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(0) = \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , such that their tangents are non-collinear at \\mathsf{X} , as before. Let us now consider an infinitesimal area element \\Delta A \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , defined as follows: \\Delta A = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(s) \\times \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(s). Without loss of generality, we will suppose that the curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2,\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3 are fixed, but \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1 is arbitrary, as long as the tangents of these curves at \\mathsf{X} are not collinear. With this definition, we can write the infinitesimal volume element \\Delta V at \\mathsf{X} defined by the curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3 as \\Delta V = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta A. As a consequence of deformation, the infinitesimal volume element \\Delta V gets transformed to the volume element \\Delta v , and the infinitesimal area element \\Delta A gets transformed to \\Delta a \\in T_{\\mathsf{\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})}}B_t . Using the transformation rule \\Delta v = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta V for volume elements, we see that \\begin{split} J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta A &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{x}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta a\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\varphi_t \\circ \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta a\\\\ &= \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta a\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}), t)\\Delta a. \\end{split} Since the curve \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1 is arbitrary, we see at once that J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\Delta A = \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}), t) \\Delta a. We obtain the transformation rule for areas after a simple rearrangement of this equation as \\Delta a = J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta A. It is worth keeping in mind that \\Delta a \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and \\Delta A \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , where \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) . To conclude this section, let us look at how the area transformation rule is typically applied in practice. Suppose that we are give a vector field \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t) on B_t . The flux F_{\\mathsf{w}} associated with this vector field is typically computed as F_{\\mathsf{w}} = \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, da, where \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) is the outward normal to B_t at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t . We can compute the flux associated with this vector field equivalently by evaluating the integral over the initial placement B_0 : F_{\\mathsf{w}} = \\int_{\\partial B_0} J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, \\mathsf{w}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{N}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, dA. Notice how the area transformation rule derived earlier for infinitesimal volumes, \" \\mathsf{n}da = J\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{N}dA \", is used in writing the foregoing equation. Defining the Piola transform of the vector field \\mathsf{w} on B_t as the vector field \\mathsf{W} on B_0 , where, for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , \\mathsf{W}(\\mathsf{X},t) = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)\\mathsf{w}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t), we see that \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da = \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{W}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{N}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dA. This formula will prove to be quite useful to us later on. Remark Note that all the area integrals encountered here are to be understood in the sense of the integrals of parametrized surfaces, as was studied earlier. Polar decomposition theorem The previous sections illustrate the fact that all the relevant information regarding the change in shape of a body as a consequence of a deformation is captured by the deformation gradient. We will now study a very important decomposition of the deformation gradient that will prove to be very useful later on. The basic idea is very simple: a deformation characterized by a pure rotation does not produce any strain; hence, if we are interested in the strain caused by a general deformation, can we extract out its purely rotational components so that we are left with only that part of the deformation that is responsible for an actual shape change? The polar decomposition theorem provides a means to effect this decomposition in a precise manner. Specifically, this theorem states that any deformation graident can be decomposed uniquely as either a pure stretch followed by a pure rotation, or a pure rotation followed by a pure stretch. Specifically, given a deformation \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t , the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , where \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , and \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\in B_t , can be decomposed uniquely as follows: \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t), where \\mathbf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t is an orthogonal map, called the rotation map , that quantifies the purely rotational part of the deformation gradient, and \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 and \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t are symmetric and positive definite tensors, called the right stretch tensor and the left stretch tensor , respectively. The decomposition \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called the right polar decomposition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) , and \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called the left polar decomposition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . The proof of the polar decomposition theorem is quite simple. To begin with, notice that the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is both symmetric and positive definite. The symmetric of \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) follows from the fact that \\mathsf{C}^T(\\mathsf{X},t) = (\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t))^T = \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t). The positive definiteness of \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) follows from the fact that for any \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\lVert \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X}\\rVert^2 \\ge 0. Further, it follows from the same argument that \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = 0 iff \\Delta X = \\mathsf{0} . Recall from our discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors that since \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) is symmetric and positive definite, we can compute its square root. Define the tensor \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as follows: \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sqrt{\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)}. It follows from the definition that \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) is both symmetric and positive definite. Define the map \\mathsf{R}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0\\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}^{-1}(\\mathsf{X},t). It is easy to check that the map \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is an orthogonal map. Indeed, note that \\mathsf{R}^T\\mathsf{R} = \\mathsf{U}^{-T}\\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F}\\mathsf{U} = \\mathsf{U}^{-1}\\mathsf{U}^2\\mathsf{U} = \\mathsf{I}, where \\mathsf{I}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is the identity tensor on T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Note that we have suppressed the arguments of the various maps to keep the notation simple. A similar argument shows that \\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{R}^T = \\mathsf{I} , where \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . This shows that \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is an orthogonal map. We have thus shown that the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) can be written as the action of a symmetric tensor followed by the action of a rotation map. We still need to show that this decomposition is unique. Towards this end, suppose that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) also admits another right polar decomposition of the form \\mathsf{F} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} , where, in the interest of notational simplicity, we have suppressed the arguments of the various maps. It follows from the following argument, \\mathsf{U}^2 = \\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}}^T\\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}}^2, that \\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} . This, along with the equation \\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} shows that \\mathsf{R} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}} , thereby establishing the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition. To prove the left decomposition, define the tensor \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: V(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sqrt{\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)}, where \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) is the left Cauchy-Green tensor. It is easily checked that \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t) is both symmetric and positive definite. It follows from an argument analogous to the previous one that the map \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t defined as S(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t), is orthogonal. We thus see that the the deformation gradient can be written in the left polar decomposition form as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{S},t) . We will now show that \\mathsf{S} \\equiv \\mathsf{R} . To see this, note that we can use the orthogonality of \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t) in the following way: \\mathsf{F} = \\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} = (\\mathsf{S}\\mathsf{S}^T)\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} = \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{S}^T\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S}). Notice now that since \\mathsf{S} is orthogonal, and \\mathsf{S}^T\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} is symmetric and positive definite, it follows from the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t),\\\\ \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\mathsf{R}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t). \\end{split} We have thus shown that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) , which this the left polar decomposition. The uniqueness of the left polar decomposition follows from an argument analogous to that of the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition. This completes the proof of the polar decomposition theorem. As a quick consistency check, let us see compute the Lagrangian strain tensor using the polar decomposition theorem: \\mathsf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} - \\mathsf{I}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathsf{U}^2 - \\mathsf{I}). We have suppressed the arguments for notational convenience. We thus see that the rotation map \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) does not contribute to the strain, as expected. A similar caculation shows that this is true for the Eulerian strain tensor too. The strain is entirely captured by the right and left stretch tensors \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) and \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t) , respectively. In this context, it is useful to mention that the eigenvalues of the right and left stretch vectors are called the right principal stretches and left principal stretches , respectively.","title":"Analysis of deformation"},{"location":"kinematics_deformation/#analysis-of-deformation","text":"We will now study the deformation of the body at fixed instant of time, say the current time instant t . In particular, we will see that all the information relevant to the change in shape of the body from the initial instant of time to the current instant of time is contained in a quantity called the deformation gradient .","title":"Analysis of Deformation"},{"location":"kinematics_deformation/#deformation","text":"Let us consider, as before, a motion (\\chi_t)_{t \\in I} of a body \\mathcal{B} as it moves and deforms in the three dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^3 .

Remark Before we proceed further, we will introduce a useful notational convention that will turn out to quite useful in the sequel. We will, for the most part, use uppercase symbols for quantities associated with the initial configuration, and lowercase symbols for quantities associated with the current configuration. This also includes the indices for components of vectors and tensors with respect to suitably chosen bases. Let us now introduce a basis for the three dimensional Euclidean space \\mathbb{R}^3 . For the sake of conceptual clarity, let us introduce two sets of bases (\\mathsf{E}_I)_{I=1}^3 and (\\mathsf{e}_i)_{i=1}^3 ; note that these are the bases chosen by a single observer. We will use the basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) to denote points in B_0 and the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) to denote points in B_t . Notice how we have used uppercase and lowercase symbols for the initial and current placements, according the convention just outlined. Remark For all practical purposes, we can identify the bases (\\mathsf{E}_I) and (\\mathsf{e}_i) of \\mathbb{R}^3 . A formal way to express this equivalence is using the equation \\mathsf{e}_i = \\sum \\delta_{iI} \\mathsf{E}_I . More generally, the bases could be related via an orthogonal matrix as follows: \\mathsf{e}_i = \\sum \\hat{Q}_{iJ} \\mathsf{E}_J , with the matrix [\\hat{\\mathsf{Q}}] whose (i,J)^{\\text{th}} entry is \\hat{Q}_{iJ} being orthogonal. Even though it is sufficient to identify the two bases for the following development, we will retain the upper and lower case notations for the purpose of conceptual clarity. Note In a more general development of continuum mechanics, the background space is itself modeled as a manifold. Since a manifold is, in general, not a linear space, the choice of a basis for space doesn't make sense in the general development. Rather, coordinates are assigned to every point on the manifold by the choice of an appropriate coordinate system. The choice of the two bases for \\mathbb{R}^3 as we have done here can be understood as the choice of two Cartesian coordinate systems, one for B_0 , and another for B_t . With this background, let us work out the coordinate representations of the deformation map. If (x_i) and (X_I) are the Cartesian coordinates of the points \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , respectively, the deformation map \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X}, t) can be written in coordinate form as follows: x_i = \\varphi_i(X_1, X_2, X_3, t), \\quad i = 1,2,3. Here \\varphi_i(\\cdot, t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R} are the component maps of \\varphi(\\cdot,t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 . We will often write this equation as x_i = \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t) . Example Consider the following deformation: x_1 = \\lambda_1 X_1, \\quad x_2 = \\lambda_2 X_2, \\quad x_3 = \\lambda_3 X_3, with \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 > 0 . This corresponds to a volumetric strain . To understand why this is the case, note that a cube of side length 1 gets transformed to a cuboid of side lengths \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 as a consequence of this deformation. Example As another example of an elementary deformation, let us consider the following: x_1 = X_1 + X_2 \\tan \\theta, \\quad x_2 = X_2, \\quad x_3 = X_3. This is an example of a pure shear .","title":"Deformation"},{"location":"kinematics_deformation/#deformation-gradient","text":"We now turn to the critical notion of the deformation gradient . As remarked earlier, this quantity carries all the information that is required to characterize the deformation of the body. But in its essence, it is a very simple idea. Note that the deformation map \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t is a nonlinear function of \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . Recall that the preferred means to study general nonlinear maps is to construct their local linearized version, and study this linearized map locally. This, in particular, involves the computation of the Frechet derivative of the nonlinear map. The Frechet derivative of the deformation map is called the deformation gradient . We will use the fact that when the Frechet derivative exists, it is identical to the Gateaux derivative, and use the latter to derive the expression for the deformation gradient. At any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , choose an arbitrary vector \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 in the tangent space to B_0 at \\mathsf{X} . Consider the line \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}:[0,\\delta] \\to B_0 defined as follows: for any s \\in [0,\\delta] , \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s) = \\mathsf{X} + s\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. Since B_0 is open, it is always possible to choose an appropriate value of \\delta > 0 so as to ensure that the image of this line lies entirely in B_0 . In the limit when \\delta \\to 0 , the material curve \\chi_0^{-1} \\circ \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}:[0,\\delta] \\to \\mathcal{B} is called an infinitesimal material line segment . It follows from a simple calculation that \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s) = \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. This just expresses the fact that the tangent vector to the curve \\bar{\\mathsf{X}} at \\mathsf{X} is \\Delta\\mathsf{X} . As a consequence of the deformation, the line \\bar{\\mathsf{X}} gets deformed to the line \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}:[0,\\delta] \\to B_t , where, for any s \\in [0,\\delta] , \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}(s) = \\varphi_t(\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s)). We will use the notation \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t to denote the tangent vector to the deformed curve \\bar{\\mathsf{x}} at \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) . We will now define the deformation gradient at \\mathsf{X} as the map \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t that maps the tangent vector \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 to the tangent vector \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_t : \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. To compute the expression for the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) in terms of the deformation map, note that \\begin{split} \\Delta \\mathsf{x} &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}(s)\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\varphi_t(\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s))\\\\ &= \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s)\\\\ &= \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. \\end{split} For reasons that will become clear later on, we will introduce a new notation: \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\text{GRAD } \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. Remark Notice that we dropped the generalized dot product in \\nabla\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{X} in writing it as \\text{GRAD }\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})\\Delta\\mathsf{X} . This is to due to the fact that the deformation gradient is actually the Frechet derivative of the deformation map. As long as we are working in Euclidean spaces, this distinction isn't really important. We will therefore write the action of the deformation map \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) on \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as follows: \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\text{GRAD } \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\Delta\\mathsf{X}. Since the deformationg gradient maps tangent vectors to curves in the initial placement to tangent vectors to curves in the current placement, it is also called as the tangent map of the deformation. Remark The symbol \\text{GRAD }\\cdot stands for the gradient operation with respect to the coordinate system chosen on B_0 . The uppercase notation is chosen to be consistent with the notational convention we chose earlier. Let us work out the coordinate representation of the deformation gradient. Since we are working within a Cartesian coordinate setting, we can choose the same basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) for all the tangent spaces of B_0 , and the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) for all the tangent spaces of B_t . If \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\sum \\Delta x_i \\mathsf{e}_i, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\sum \\Delta X_I \\mathsf{E}_I, then it follows from a straightforward calculation that \\Delta x_i = \\sum F_{iI}\\Delta X_I = \\sum \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_I} \\Delta X_I. The coordinate representation of the deformation gradient follows immediately as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, where F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}. We will at times use the shorthand notation F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\varphi_{i,J}(\\mathsf{X},t) to write this equation. Note that the components of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) can be arranged into a matrix [\\mathsf{F}] whose (i,J)^{\\text{th}} entry is F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) . In terms of this matrix, we see that \\begin{bmatrix} \\Delta x_1\\\\ \\Delta x_2\\\\ \\Delta x_3\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} F_{11} & F_{12} & F_{13}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22} & F_{23}\\\\ F_{31} & F_{32} & F_{33} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\Delta X_1\\\\ \\Delta X_2\\\\ \\Delta X_3\\end{bmatrix}, or, in a much more concise form, [\\Delta \\mathsf{x}] = [\\mathsf{F}][\\Delta\\mathsf{X}] . Let us quickly look into the physical meaning of the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . Suppose that \\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{X}' \\in B_0 are two neighboring points, and let \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{X}' - \\mathsf{X} . Let the corresponding points in the current placement be \\mathsf{x}, \\mathsf{x}' \\in B_t , and let \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{x} - \\mathsf{x}' . In the limit when the line joining \\mathsf{X} and \\mathsf{X}' in B_0 corresponds to an infinitesimal material line segment in \\mathcal{B} , it follows from a simple application of Taylor's theorem that \\begin{split} x'_i &= \\varphi_i(X'_1, X'_2, X'_3, t)\\\\ &= \\varphi_i(X_1 + \\Delta X_1, X_2 + \\Delta X_2, X_3 + \\Delta X_3, t)\\\\ &= \\varphi_i(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) + \\sum \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(X_1,X_2,X_3,t)}{\\partial X_I} \\Delta X_I + o(\\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X}\\rVert^2). \\end{split} Rearranging this, we see that \\Delta x_i \\simeq \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta X_I. The deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) thus tells us how two neighboring points in the initial placement get relatively deformed as a consequence of the deformation. Remark In the derivation above, o(\\cdot) stands for the little 'o' symbol. This is defined as follows: given functions f, g:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} , we say that f = o(g) at x_* \\in \\mathbb{R} if it is true that \\lim_{x \\to x_*} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0. The extension to higher dimensional functions is similarly defined. Let us know revisit the examples we studied in the previous section and compute their deformation gradient Example For the case of a volumetric strain deformation with x_1 = \\lambda_1 X_1 , x_2 = \\lambda_2 X_2 and x_3 = \\lambda_3 X_3 , it follows from a simple computation that F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum \\lambda_i \\delta_{iJ} \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. In matrix form, [\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)] = \\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{bmatrix}. It is a good idea to relate this deformation gradient to the effect the volumetric strain deformation has on a unit cube. Example Let us consider the example of pure shear, with x_1 = X_1 + \\tan \\theta X_2 , x_2 = X_2 and x_3 = X_3 . It follows from a straightforward calculation that [\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, where s = \\tan \\theta denotes the amount of shear. Note that the deformation gradient can be equivalenlty written as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{I} + s \\mathsf{e}_1 \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_2. Here, \\mathsf{I}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t is the identity map that maps the basis (E_I) of T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 to the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) of T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . In practice, we will often have a few other restrictions on the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . In particular, we will always assume that the deformation gradient is invertible. This implies, in particular that the determinant of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) is non-zero. We will, in fact, show shortly that for physically admissible deformations, \\text{det}(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)) > 0 . We will therefore assume in the sequel the existence of the inverse deformation map \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 .","title":"Deformation gradient"},{"location":"kinematics_deformation/#length-transformation","text":"Let us now see how the length of an infinitesimal line element changes as a consequence of deformation. In what follows, we will identify, as in the preceeding discussions, an infinitesimal line element with an element of the appropriate tangent space. Thus, suppose that the vector \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is mapped to \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t by the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . It follows from a simple calculation that \\begin{split} \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x}\\rVert^2 &= \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= (\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot (\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X})\\\\ &= \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}, \\end{split} where \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t) . Note that \\mathsf{F}^T:T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . We now introduce the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t). Remark Many engineering textbooks write the foregoing equation as \\mathsf{C} = \\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} . We will adopt such a simplified notation when it suits our needs. But it should always be kept in mind what such shorthand notations actually mean. In terms of the bases (\\mathsf{E}_I) and (\\mathsf{e}_i) of the respective tangent spaces, it follows from a simple calculation that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i,\\\\ \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. \\end{split} Remark It is instructive to pause here and reflect on the mathematical difference between the quantities \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Both these are linear maps, and can be converted into tensors on the product spaces T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\otimes T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\otimes T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , respectively. Notice how the definition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) involves two distinct vector spaces, while \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) depends only on one vector space. For this reason, \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called a two-point tensor , while \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) is a tensor in the usual sense of the term as we studied earlier. Returning to our discussion of the change in the length of an infinitesimal line segment as a consequence of deformation, it follows from the developments so far that \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 = \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\left(\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}, where \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Introducing the Green-Lagrange strain tensor , also called the Lagrangian strain tensor , \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right), we see that the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment can be expressed in terms of the Lagrangian strain tensor as \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 = 2\\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. We thus see that the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment is dictated by the Lagrangian strain tensor. In terms of the basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) of T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , it is straightfoward to verify that \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, \\qquad E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(C_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\delta_{IJ}\\right). Here, C_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) are the components of the right Cauchy-Green tensor, and \\delta_{IJ} is the Kronecker delta symbol. The diagonal component fields E_{II}(\\mathsf{X},t) are called axial , or tensile strains, while the off-diagonal component fields E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) , with I \\neq J are called shear strains. The preceeding discussion allowed us to study the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment in the Lagrangian description. Alternatively, we can describe the same phenomena from the Eulerian viewpoint. Following the same line of thought as above, we see that \\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. Defining the left Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t), where \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) , it follows that \\begin{split} \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X} &= \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{b}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. \\end{split} The Eulerian strain tensor , also called the Almansi strain tensor , is the map \\mathsf{e}:T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t defined as follows: \\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right). Here, \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . Using these definitions, we can now compute the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment in the Eulerian description as follows: \\begin{split} \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 &= \\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{x} - \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{b}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= 2\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. \\end{split} It is important to note the following identity: \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2\\right) = \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. Thus, the same physical phenomena can be expressed in two complementary viewpoints. It is however important to develop concrete relations like the one above that express the mutual compatibility of such distinct but equivalent descriptions. Example We would intuitively expect a body undergoing a pure translation or a pure rotation to have zero strain since the relative positions of the body do not change under these kinds of deformations. Let us verify this. Suppose that we are given a deformation \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t of the following form: for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) = \\mathsf{c} + \\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X} - \\mathsf{O}), where \\mathsf{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is a constant vector, and \\mathsf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is some fixed point in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Further, we will assume that the constant map \\mathsf{Q}:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 is orthogonal. With these assumptions, it is clear that this denotes a deformation consisting of a rotation according to the rotation map \\mathsf{Q} about the point \\mathsf{O} followed by a uniform translation \\mathsf{c} . It is left as a straightforward exercise to compute that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{Q}, and, consequently, that \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{0} , and \\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{0} . We thus see that the definition of strain that we have developed is consistent with our intuitive sense of how a strain ought to behave. Once we know how an infinitesimal line element changes in length as a consequence of deformation, the change in length of an arbitrary curve in the initial placement can be computed. Specifically, suppose that \\gamma:I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} \\to B_0 is a curve in B_0 . The length of this curve, L_\\gamma is computed as follows: L_{\\gamma} = \\int_I \\lVert D\\gamma(t)\\rVert dt. Remark It is not difficult to show that the length thus defined is independent of the parametrization of the curve. Indeed, suppose that there exists a smooth, monotonically increasing and surjective function \\tau:I \\to J \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} such that we can formulate an alternative parametrization of the line \\gamma(I) as the curve \\tilde{\\gamma}:J \\to B_0 as follows: \\tilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma \\circ \\tau^{-1} . Let \\tilde{L}_\\gamma denote the length of the curve \\tilde\\gamma ; we expect, based on the fact that \\gamma(I) = \\tilde{\\gamma}(J) that \\tilde{L}_\\gamma = L_\\gamma . Let us verify this: \\begin{split} L_\\gamma &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\gamma(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D(\\tilde\\gamma \\circ \\tau)(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\tilde\\gamma(\\tau(t))\\rVert D\\tau(t) dt\\\\ &= \\int_J \\lVert D\\tilde\\gamma(s) \\rVert ds\\\\ &= \\tilde{L}_\\gamma. \\end{split} In deriving this equation, use has been made of the fact that D\\tau(t) > 0 for every t \\in I . We now wish to find the length l_{\\gamma} of the deformed curve \\varphi_t \\circ \\gamma: I \\to B_t . This follows at once from the following calculation: \\begin{split} l_\\gamma &= \\int_I \\lVert D(\\varphi_t \\circ \\gamma)(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\varphi(\\gamma(t), t) D\\gamma(t)\\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\sqrt{\\mathsf{F}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t)} \\,dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\sqrt{D\\gamma(t) \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t)} \\,dt. \\end{split} We thus see that a knowledge of the deformation gradient allows us to compute the lengths of any curve in the initial placement.","title":"Length transformation"},{"location":"kinematics_deformation/#volume-transformation","text":"Let us now study how a volume of space occupied by the body at the initial time changes as a consequence of the deformation.

Without loss of generality, we will suppose that the curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2,\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3 are fixed, but \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1 is arbitrary, as long as the tangents of these curves at \\mathsf{X} are not collinear. With this definition, we can write the infinitesimal volume element \\Delta V at \\mathsf{X} defined by the curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3 as \\Delta V = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta A. As a consequence of deformation, the infinitesimal volume element \\Delta V gets transformed to the volume element \\Delta v , and the infinitesimal area element \\Delta A gets transformed to \\Delta a \\in T_{\\mathsf{\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})}}B_t . Using the transformation rule \\Delta v = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta V for volume elements, we see that \\begin{split} J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta A &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{x}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta a\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\varphi_t \\circ \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta a\\\\ &= \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta a\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}), t)\\Delta a. \\end{split} Since the curve \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1 is arbitrary, we see at once that J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\Delta A = \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}), t) \\Delta a. We obtain the transformation rule for areas after a simple rearrangement of this equation as \\Delta a = J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta A. It is worth keeping in mind that \\Delta a \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and \\Delta A \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , where \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) . To conclude this section, let us look at how the area transformation rule is typically applied in practice. Suppose that we are give a vector field \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t) on B_t . The flux F_{\\mathsf{w}} associated with this vector field is typically computed as F_{\\mathsf{w}} = \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, da, where \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) is the outward normal to B_t at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t . We can compute the flux associated with this vector field equivalently by evaluating the integral over the initial placement B_0 : F_{\\mathsf{w}} = \\int_{\\partial B_0} J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, \\mathsf{w}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{N}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, dA. Notice how the area transformation rule derived earlier for infinitesimal volumes, \" \\mathsf{n}da = J\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{N}dA \", is used in writing the foregoing equation. Defining the Piola transform of the vector field \\mathsf{w} on B_t as the vector field \\mathsf{W} on B_0 , where, for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , \\mathsf{W}(\\mathsf{X},t) = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)\\mathsf{w}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t), we see that \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da = \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{W}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{N}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dA. This formula will prove to be quite useful to us later on. Remark Note that all the area integrals encountered here are to be understood in the sense of the integrals of parametrized surfaces, as was studied earlier.","title":"Area transformation"},{"location":"kinematics_deformation/#polar-decomposition-theorem","text":"The previous sections illustrate the fact that all the relevant information regarding the change in shape of a body as a consequence of a deformation is captured by the deformation gradient. We will now study a very important decomposition of the deformation gradient that will prove to be very useful later on. The basic idea is very simple: a deformation characterized by a pure rotation does not produce any strain; hence, if we are interested in the strain caused by a general deformation, can we extract out its purely rotational components so that we are left with only that part of the deformation that is responsible for an actual shape change? The polar decomposition theorem provides a means to effect this decomposition in a precise manner. Specifically, this theorem states that any deformation graident can be decomposed uniquely as either a pure stretch followed by a pure rotation, or a pure rotation followed by a pure stretch. Specifically, given a deformation \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t , the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , where \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , and \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\in B_t , can be decomposed uniquely as follows: \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t), where \\mathbf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t is an orthogonal map, called the rotation map , that quantifies the purely rotational part of the deformation gradient, and \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 and \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t are symmetric and positive definite tensors, called the right stretch tensor and the left stretch tensor , respectively. The decomposition \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called the right polar decomposition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) , and \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called the left polar decomposition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . The proof of the polar decomposition theorem is quite simple. To begin with, notice that the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is both symmetric and positive definite. The symmetric of \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) follows from the fact that \\mathsf{C}^T(\\mathsf{X},t) = (\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t))^T = \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t). The positive definiteness of \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) follows from the fact that for any \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\lVert \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X}\\rVert^2 \\ge 0. Further, it follows from the same argument that \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = 0 iff \\Delta X = \\mathsf{0} . Recall from our discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors that since \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) is symmetric and positive definite, we can compute its square root. Define the tensor \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as follows: \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sqrt{\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)}. It follows from the definition that \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) is both symmetric and positive definite. Define the map \\mathsf{R}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0\\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}^{-1}(\\mathsf{X},t). It is easy to check that the map \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is an orthogonal map. Indeed, note that \\mathsf{R}^T\\mathsf{R} = \\mathsf{U}^{-T}\\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F}\\mathsf{U} = \\mathsf{U}^{-1}\\mathsf{U}^2\\mathsf{U} = \\mathsf{I}, where \\mathsf{I}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is the identity tensor on T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Note that we have suppressed the arguments of the various maps to keep the notation simple. A similar argument shows that \\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{R}^T = \\mathsf{I} , where \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . This shows that \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is an orthogonal map. We have thus shown that the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) can be written as the action of a symmetric tensor followed by the action of a rotation map. We still need to show that this decomposition is unique. Towards this end, suppose that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) also admits another right polar decomposition of the form \\mathsf{F} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} , where, in the interest of notational simplicity, we have suppressed the arguments of the various maps. It follows from the following argument, \\mathsf{U}^2 = \\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}}^T\\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}}^2, that \\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} . This, along with the equation \\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} shows that \\mathsf{R} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}} , thereby establishing the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition. To prove the left decomposition, define the tensor \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: V(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sqrt{\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)}, where \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) is the left Cauchy-Green tensor. It is easily checked that \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t) is both symmetric and positive definite. It follows from an argument analogous to the previous one that the map \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t defined as S(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t), is orthogonal. We thus see that the the deformation gradient can be written in the left polar decomposition form as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{S},t) . We will now show that \\mathsf{S} \\equiv \\mathsf{R} . To see this, note that we can use the orthogonality of \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t) in the following way: \\mathsf{F} = \\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} = (\\mathsf{S}\\mathsf{S}^T)\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} = \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{S}^T\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S}). Notice now that since \\mathsf{S} is orthogonal, and \\mathsf{S}^T\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} is symmetric and positive definite, it follows from the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t),\\\\ \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\mathsf{R}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t). \\end{split} We have thus shown that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) , which this the left polar decomposition. The uniqueness of the left polar decomposition follows from an argument analogous to that of the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition. This completes the proof of the polar decomposition theorem. As a quick consistency check, let us see compute the Lagrangian strain tensor using the polar decomposition theorem: \\mathsf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} - \\mathsf{I}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathsf{U}^2 - \\mathsf{I}). We have suppressed the arguments for notational convenience. We thus see that the rotation map \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) does not contribute to the strain, as expected. A similar caculation shows that this is true for the Eulerian strain tensor too. The strain is entirely captured by the right and left stretch tensors \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) and \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t) , respectively. In this context, it is useful to mention that the eigenvalues of the right and left stretch vectors are called the right principal stretches and left principal stretches , respectively.","title":"Polar decomposition theorem"},{"location":"kinematics_intro/","text":"Basic definitions in Kinematics Observers/frames of reference We will now introduce the crucial notion of an observer , or, equivalently, a frame of reference . For our purposes, a frame of reference is defined as a map that assigns to each event \\mathfrak{e} in spacetime a unique time and space coordinates : \\mathfrak{e} \\mapsto (\\mathsf{x}, t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R}. Here \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 and t \\in \\mathbb{R} are the position and time coordinates of the event \\mathsf{e} according to the observer, or, equivalently, according to the frame of reference. Suppose that we have a second observer who assigns coordinates \\mathsf{x}^*,t^* to the same event \\mathfrak{e} , then the observer transformation map, or, equivalently, the change of reference frame map is computed as (\\mathsf{x},t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} \\mapsto (\\mathsf{x}^*,t^*) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}. We will assume that this is a diffeomorphism on \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} . Recall that a diffeomorphism is an invertible map such that both it and its inverse are continuously differentiable. Remark The space in which the collection of all events \\mathfrak{e} reside is not defined here. What is actually behind this definition is the assumption of a flat spacetime, in line with the Newtonian view of absolute space and absolute time. Rather than getting into the details of this definition, it is sufficient to focus only on the observer transformation/change of reference frame maps, which are diffeomorphisms on \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} since that is what we will need in this course. Bodies, configurations and deformations A body \\mathcal{B} is defined as an abstract collection of material points . This is a useful abstraction for the development of continuum mechanics. In practice, what we are interested is how the body \\mathcal{B} moves and deforms in space over a period of time. Towards this end, it is helpful to introduce the notion of a configuration of the body in space. A configuration of the body \\mathcal{B} is a map of the form \\chi:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3, that assigns coordinates \\chi(p) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 to every material point p \\in \\mathcal{B} . The image B = \\chi(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 of the body \\mathcal{B} under \\chi is called the placement of the body \\mathcal{B} according to the configuration \\chi . We will typically assume that B is an open subset of \\mathbb{R}^3 . Further, we will assume that the map \\chi:\\mathcal{B}\\to\\mathbb{R}^3 is injective, or, equivalently, that \\chi:\\mathcal{B} \\to B is bijective. Remark It is important to distinguish between the configuration and placement of a body. For instance, a homogeneous cylinder, and a twisted version of the cylinder both occupy the same region of space, but amount to distinct configurations. Note The assumption that B = \\chi(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 is open in \\mathbb{R}^3 is quite a strong one. For instance, this precludes bodies that occupy a two dimensional surface or one dimensional curves in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Such special bodies are important for certain applications; appropriate extensions of the theories developed here using the tools of differential geometry need to be developed to handle those cases. We focus on the simple case mentioned here in the interest of keeping the mathematical development simple. Suppose now that \\chi_1 and \\chi_2 are two configurations of \\mathcal{B} , the deformation of the body with respect to these configurations is the map \\varphi:B_1 \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to B_2 \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3, where B_1 = \\chi_1(\\mathcal{B}) and B_2 = \\chi_2(\\mathcal{B}) . Notice that the deformation of a body is a map between open subsets of \\mathbb{R}^3 , which are much easier to handle than the abstract configuration maps. For this reason, we will work almost entirely with deformation maps from now on. We will further assume that all the deformation maps we encounter in these notes are diffeomorphisms: this means that they are invertible, and both the deformation and its inverse are smoothly differentiable. Motion of the body in space Let us now look at how a body is described by an observer, or, equivalently, how a body is represented in a frame of reference. The observer assigns, for every instant of time t \\in \\mathbb{R} according to her clock, a configuration \\chi_t:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 such that the body occupies the region B_t = \\chi_t(\\mathcal{B}) . Note that this description is with respect to the specific coordinate system attached to the observer. The sequence of configurations (\\chi_t)_{t \\in I} , where I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} is a time interval of interest, of the body \\mathcal{B} according to the observer is called a motion of \\mathcal{B} in \\mathbb{R}^3 . The one-parameter family of deformation maps \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t , where t \\in I , is defined as follows: for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 = \\chi_0(\\mathcal{B}) , \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) = \\chi_t \\circ \\chi_0^{-1}(\\mathsf{X}). It is useful to introduce the following related variants of the deformation map: \\varphi:B_0 \\times I \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 defined as \\varphi(\\mathsf{X}, t) = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) , and \\varphi_{\\mathsf{X}}:I \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 defined as \\varphi_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t) . A few important terminologies that will be used repeatedly in our development of continuum mechanics are introduced now. In the description of the motion and deformation of a body in space, it is often possible to single out a special configuration \\chi_R:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 called the reference configuration . The corresponding image B_R = \\chi_R(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 is called the reference placement of the body \\mathcal{B} . It is important to note that a reference configuration need not necessarily be a configuration of the body during the motion of the body as observed by an observer. However, it is convenient and typical to identify the reference configuration with the configuration of the body at the initial instant of time, as observered by an observer. Without loss of generality, we can assume the initial instant of time to correspond to t = 0 \\in I . The configuration at t = 0 , \\chi_0:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 , is called the initial configuration . The corresponding image B_0 = \\chi_0(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 is called the initial placement of the body \\mathcal{B} . The configuration of the body at the current instant of time, \\chi_t:\\mathcal{B}\\to\\mathbb{R}^3 is called the current configuration of the body \\mathcal{B} , and the corresponding image B_t = \\chi_t(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 is called its current placement . Note For the sake of simplicity, we will identify the reference configuration with the initial configuration throughout these notes. These two terms will therefore be used interchangeably. It should however be kept in mind that it is perfectly well admissible to have distinct initial and reference configurations. Lagrangian vs Eulerian viewpoints Consider a motion \\chi_t:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 of a body \\mathcal{B} in three dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^3 according to an observer. Let \\chi_0 and \\chi_t be the initial and current configurations, respectively, of the body. Let B_0 and B_t be the initial and current placements, respectively, of the body in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Let us now focus on a real valued physical property of the body. We will now see how the same observer can talk about this physical quantity in many different ways, depending on the point of view she adopts. For concreteness, let us suppose we are interested in assigning a temperature to every point of the body \\mathcal{B} at the current time t . This amounts to a map of the form \\theta_t:B_t\\to\\mathbb{R} that assigns a temperature \\theta_t(\\mathsf{x}) to every point \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t . This is called the Eulerian , or, spatial description of the temperature field. We will also write \\theta(\\mathsf{x},t) for \\theta_t(\\mathsf{x}) . Thus, \\theta(\\mathsf{x},t) denotes the temperature of the material point \\chi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) at the current time t . We can alternatively describe the temperature at the current instant of time in terms of either the initial/reference configuration or the material body as follows. If \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) \\in B_0 is the position occupied by the material point \\chi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) at time t = 0 , then we can define the Lagrangian , or, referential , or initial description of the current temperature using the map \\Theta_t:B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R}, \\qquad \\mathsf{X} \\mapsto \\Theta_t(\\mathsf{X}) = \\theta_t(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})). Note again that this is the temperature at the current time t of the particle that initially occupied the position \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . Finally, we can also talk about the current temperature in terms of the material points using the maps \\hat{\\Theta}_t:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}, \\qquad p \\mapsto \\hat{\\Theta}_t(p) = \\theta_t(\\chi_t(p)). This is called the material description of the current temperature of the material particle p . Note Some authors use the terms material and Lagrangian/initial interchangeably. If a particular reference configuration that is distinct from the initial configuration is present, then the reference description refers to a description with respect to the reference configuration, and the terms Lagrangian/initial are reserved exclusively for the description with respect to the initial placement. It is always a good idea to be aware of the specific conventions followed in each case. To reiterate a very important point, note that all these descriptions pertain to the description of the temperature field at the current instant of time t . This is summarized in the following equation: \\theta(\\mathsf{x},\\mathbf{t}) = \\Theta(\\mathsf{X},\\mathbf{t}) = \\hat{\\Theta}(p,\\mathbf{t}). Here, \\mathsf{X} = \\chi_0(p) and \\mathsf{x} = \\chi_t(p) . Remark The pointwise assignment of temperature at every instant of time as outlined before is an example of a scalar field. The material, Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of vector and tensor fields are defined in an analogous manner.","title":"Kinematics - basic definitions"},{"location":"kinematics_intro/#basic-definitions-in-kinematics","text":"","title":"Basic definitions in Kinematics"},{"location":"kinematics_intro/#observersframes-of-reference","text":"We will now introduce the crucial notion of an observer , or, equivalently, a frame of reference .

Without loss of generality, we can assume the initial instant of time to correspond to t = 0 \\in I . The configuration at t = 0 , \\chi_0:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 , is called the initial configuration . The corresponding image B_0 = \\chi_0(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 is called the initial placement of the body \\mathcal{B} . The configuration of the body at the current instant of time, \\chi_t:\\mathcal{B}\\to\\mathbb{R}^3 is called the current configuration of the body \\mathcal{B} , and the corresponding image B_t = \\chi_t(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 is called its current placement . Note For the sake of simplicity, we will identify the reference configuration with the initial configuration throughout these notes. These two terms will therefore be used interchangeably. It should however be kept in mind that it is perfectly well admissible to have distinct initial and reference configurations.","title":"Motion of the body in space"},{"location":"kinematics_intro/#lagrangian-vs-eulerian-viewpoints","text":"Consider a motion \\chi_t:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 of a body \\mathcal{B} in three dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^3 according to an observer. Let \\chi_0 and \\chi_t be the initial and current configurations, respectively, of the body. Let B_0 and B_t be the initial and current placements, respectively, of the body in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Let us now focus on a real valued physical property of the body. We will now see how the same observer can talk about this physical quantity in many different ways, depending on the point of view she adopts. For concreteness, let us suppose we are interested in assigning a temperature to every point of the body \\mathcal{B} at the current time t . This amounts to a map of the form \\theta_t:B_t\\to\\mathbb{R} that assigns a temperature \\theta_t(\\mathsf{x}) to every point \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t . This is called the Eulerian , or, spatial description of the temperature field. We will also write \\theta(\\mathsf{x},t) for \\theta_t(\\mathsf{x}) . Thus, \\theta(\\mathsf{x},t) denotes the temperature of the material point \\chi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) at the current time t . We can alternatively describe the temperature at the current instant of time in terms of either the initial/reference configuration or the material body as follows. If \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) \\in B_0 is the position occupied by the material point \\chi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) at time t = 0 , then we can define the Lagrangian , or, referential , or initial description of the current temperature using the map \\Theta_t:B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R}, \\qquad \\mathsf{X} \\mapsto \\Theta_t(\\mathsf{X}) = \\theta_t(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})). Note again that this is the temperature at the current time t of the particle that initially occupied the position \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . Finally, we can also talk about the current temperature in terms of the material points using the maps \\hat{\\Theta}_t:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}, \\qquad p \\mapsto \\hat{\\Theta}_t(p) = \\theta_t(\\chi_t(p)). This is called the material description of the current temperature of the material particle p . Note Some authors use the terms material and Lagrangian/initial interchangeably. If a particular reference configuration that is distinct from the initial configuration is present, then the reference description refers to a description with respect to the reference configuration, and the terms Lagrangian/initial are reserved exclusively for the description with respect to the initial placement. It is always a good idea to be aware of the specific conventions followed in each case. To reiterate a very important point, note that all these descriptions pertain to the description of the temperature field at the current instant of time t . This is summarized in the following equation: \\theta(\\mathsf{x},\\mathbf{t}) = \\Theta(\\mathsf{X},\\mathbf{t}) = \\hat{\\Theta}(p,\\mathbf{t}). Here, \\mathsf{X} = \\chi_0(p) and \\mathsf{x} = \\chi_t(p) . Remark The pointwise assignment of temperature at every instant of time as outlined before is an example of a scalar field. The material, Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of vector and tensor fields are defined in an analogous manner.","title":"Lagrangian vs Eulerian viewpoints"},{"location":"kinematics_motion/","text":"Analysis of motion Our discussion of kinematics thus far has focused on the deformation of the initial placement of a body to its current placement. We will now consider the time evolution of a body as it moves and deforms in three dimensional space. We will begin our discussion by focusing on the evolution of a single material point, and subsequently extend it to the time evolution of the deformation gradient. We will, in particular, derive the mass continuity equation as an illustration of working with time derivatives. Finally, we will have a look at the important topic of taking the time derivatives of integrals whose domain and integrands both depend on time. Basic definitions Suppose that (\\chi_t)_{t \\in I} is a motion of a material body \\mathcal{B} in three dimensional space, as observed by an observer. At the initial instant of time, chosen without loss of generality as t = 0 , the body occupies the open subset B_0 \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 of three dimensional space. Let us now focus attention on a fixed point \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and track its evolution as the body moves and deforms in space over the time interval I . The path followed by the body, given by \\{\\varphi_{\\mathsf{X}}:I \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 \\,|\\, \\text{ for any } t \\in I, \\; \\varphi_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t)\\}, is called the pathline of the point \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . Different particles will have different pathlines, but they never intersect owing to the fact that J(\\mathsf{X},t) > 0 . Remark Pathlines are especially convenient when working with solids, where the correlation between the instantaneous relative positions of the particles remain similar over typical time intervals of interest. In fluids, on the other hand, the chaotic nature of the motion often results in the pathlines being intricately mixed and knotted. In such cases, it is more helpful to work with the streamlines and streaklines . A streamline is a line, defined at every instant of time, such that the tangent vector at any point on the line coincides with the velocity of the particle occupying that position at that specific instant of time. Note that a streamline is globally computed at a given time instant, and can vary over time. A streakline , on the other hand, is the trace of the current position of every particle that occupied a particular fixed point at some previous instant of time. A streakline is what is observed when a dye is injected in a fluid flow a fixed point. Material velocity and acceleration The material velocity of the particle initially at \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 is defined as the map \\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{X}}:I \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 such that, for any t \\in I , \\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) = \\frac{\\partial \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}. We will also use the notation \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t) in place of \\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) , when convenient. If the observer chooses a global basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) for \\mathbb{R}^3 , then the components of the material velocity can be written as \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum V_i(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{e}_i. Note that we use lowercase subscript indices to indicate the components of \\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) . This is because of the fact that though the spatial reference of the point whose velocity we compute is \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , the velocity vector at time (t) is itself not in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , but rather in T_{\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})}\\mathbb{R}^3 . Remark Note also that if we focus on a particular instant of time t , \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t) is not necessarily in T_{\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})}B_t , but rather in T_{\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})}\\mathbb{R}^3 . This is due to the fact that if the body were a surface or a curve in three dimensional space, then T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\subsetneq T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 for every \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t . Since we only deal with cases where the placement of the body at any instant of time is an open subset of \\mathbb{R}^3 , thereby excluding surface-like and line-like bodies from our discussion, this distinction is not important for our purposes. It is nevertheless a good idea to keep this distinction in mind for the sake of conceptual clarity. The material acceleration of the particle initially at \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 is defined as the map \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}:I \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 such that, for any instant of time t \\in I , \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}. As before, we will use the notation \\mathsf{A}(\\mathsf{X},t) in place of \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) when required. Given a global coordinate system, the components of the material acceleration can be computed just as in the case of the material velocity. Remark Techincally speaking, the material acceleration \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) of a particle intially at \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 at time t lives in the linear space T_{\\mathsf{x}}(T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3) , where \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) . However, since the tangent space at a point is always a linear space, we will use the more relaxed notion that \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 . Spatial velocity and acceleration The material version of the velocity and acceleration are quite convenient when studying the behavior of solids. When working with fluids, it is more convenient to focus on the nature of the particles occupying a given point in space at a given instant of time, rather than tracking individual particles (which is often infeasible). Towards this end, we will develop the spatial versions of the velocities and accelerations. Suppose that the body occupies the region B_t \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 at the instant of time t \\in I . Let us focus on a point \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t and denote by \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 the velocity of the particle that occupies the position \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t at the instant of time t . Since this is nothing but the velocity at time t of the particle that was intially at \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) , we have the following identity: \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}), t). The spatial velocity of the particle at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is defined as the map \\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{x}}:I \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 such that \\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{x}}(t) = \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) , for any t \\in I . Remark By defining, for any t \\in I , \\mathsf{v}_t:B_t \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 and \\mathsf{V}_t:B_0 \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 in the usual manner, we see that \\mathsf{v}_t = \\mathsf{V}_t \\circ \\varphi_t^{-1} . The spatial acceleration , \\mathsf{a}_{\\mathsf{x}}:I \\to T\\mathbb {R}^3 , of the particle at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is defined similarly as the acceleration of the particle that was initially at \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) : for any t \\in I , \\mathsf{a}_{\\mathsf{x}}(t) = \\mathsf{A}(\\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}), t). As before, we will at times use the notation \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) in place of \\mathsf{a}_{\\mathsf{x}}(t) . If the observer chooses a global basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) for \\mathbb{R}^3 , the components of the spatial velocity can be expressed as \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sum v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{e}_i. The coordinate representation of the spatial acceleration is computed likewise. Material time derivatives Recall that the material acceleration is the time derivative of the material velocity. Let us now look at the relation between the spatial velocity and the spatial acceleration. For any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\in B_t , we see that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\mathsf{A}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{v}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t), t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). \\end{split} Let us now introduce the material time derivative , D\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)/Dt , of the spatial velocity as follows: \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). Remark We have introduce the notation \\text{grad }\\cdot to denote the gradient of a field variable that depends on \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Note that this is different from the gradient operation \\text{GRAD }\\cdot that is defined only for fields defined on B_0 . We thus obtain the following relation between the spatial velocity and the spatial acceleration: \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt}. Unlike the relation between the material velocity and the material acceleration, the spatial acceleration is not the (partial) time derivative of the spatial velocity; in addition to the partial time derivative of the spatial velocity with respect to time, it also has the the convective term \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) . The physical intuition behind this expression for the spatial acceleration is that the velocity at a given point in space changes as a consequence of both a local change in velocity, and because of material convected to the considered point due to the motion of the body. Let us quickly work out the expression for the material time derivative of the velocity according to a global basis \\mathsf{e}_i of \\mathbb{R}^3 chosen by an observer. It follows from a simple calculation that a_i(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_j}v_j(\\mathsf{x},t). Note It is important to note that \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} \\neq \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} in general. Many authors write the convective term of the material time derivative of the spatial velocity as \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathsf{v} in place of what we write as \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} . To avoid ambiguity, we will always use the notation \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} . For completeness, let us also note that the material time derivative of the material velocity is defined simply as the partial time derivative: \\frac{D\\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}. Notice how the same term material time derivative is used to describe the time derivative as we follow a particle for both material and spatial velocity fields. Though this terminology can be confusing, it does not cause any problems in practice since the meaning is always evident from the context. Remark Many authors use the notation \\dot{\\mathsf{v}}(\\mathsf{x},t) for the material time derivative. We will also adopt this convention at places. In terms of this notation, the relation between the spatial velocity and spatial acceleration can be written succinctly as \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\dot{\\mathsf{v}}(\\mathsf{x},t) . Note that in the case of the material velocity, the dot notation is identical to the partial derivative with respect to time. The foregoing definition of the material time derivative can be extended to both scalar and tensor fields. For instance, if \\tau(\\mathsf{x},t) \\in \\otimes^k T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 denotes a tensor field of order k , then its material time derivative is computed as \\frac{D\\tau(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\tau(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\tau(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). The material time derivative of a material tensor field is simply its partial time derivative. Time derivaties related to deformation Let us now turn our attention to the time evolution of quantities associated with the deformation of a body in three dimensional space. To keep the discussion simple, only the time derivatives of a few important quantities associated with the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) are considered in detail. For the purpose of this discussion, we will use two sets of bases: (\\mathsf{E}_I) for quantities associated with the initial placement B_0 , and (\\mathsf{e}_i) for the ambient three dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^3 . Note that these are chosen by a given observer. Note also that these are often identical to each other, and the distinction is retained here purely for the purpose of conceptual clarity. Let us start with the time evolution of the deformation gradient itself. The material time derivative of the deformation gradient, which is identical to its partial derivative with respect to time, is given in coordinate form as \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum \\frac{\\partial{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. It is worth reiterating that \\dot{\\mathsf{F}} stands for the material time derivative of \\mathsf{F} . The material time derivative of the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is computed similarly: \\begin{split} \\dot{\\mathsf{C}}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\sum F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J\\right)\\\\ &= \\sum \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) + F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{\\partial F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\right) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. \\end{split} Noting that \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t) = \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i , we see that \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t) = \\sum \\frac{\\partial F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i. We therefore arrive at the following expression for the material time derivative of the right Cauchy-Green tensor: \\dot{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) + \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t). The Lagrangian rate of deformation tensor \\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is defined as \\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{D\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{Dt}. To understand the physical relevance of this tensor, consider two vectors \\Delta \\mathsf{X}, \\Delta \\mathsf{Y} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . The angle between these two vectors is computed using \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\Delta\\mathsf{Y} . As the body deforms in space accoring to a prescribed motion, the inner product of the corresponding deformed vectors also evolves with time. Let us compute the rate at which this change: \\begin{split} \\frac{D(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y})}{Dt} &= \\frac{D(\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y})}{Dt}\\\\ &= 2\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y}. \\end{split} We thus see that the Lagrangian rate of deformation tensor gives us information about how the angle between two vectors in a given tangent space evolve as a consequence of deformation. As a final and non-trivial example of computing the material time derivatives related to the deformation, let us compute the material time derivative of the determinant of the deformation gradient, but this time around, in the Eulerian setting. Recall that the Jacobian of the deformation is defined as J(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\text{det }\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and t \\in I . The spatial version of the Jacobian, which we will denote as J(\\mathsf{x},t) , where \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , is defined as J(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\text{det }\\mathsf{J}(\\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}), t). Note that we are using the same symbol \\mathsf{J} for both the material and spatial versions of the Jacobian; this is largely done because of conventional practice in the continuum mechanics literature. We will now show that the material time derivative of the Jacobian, when expressed in the Eulerian form, is given by \\frac{DJ(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\mathsf{J}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). Here, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) stands for the divergence, with respect to the spatial variable \\mathsf{x} , of the spatial velocity \\mathsf{v}_t(\\mathsf{x}) . This equation will play a key role in deriving various results in the forthcoming sections; it is worthwhile working out the proof of this statement. To keep the algebra simple, let us focus on the special case of motion in a two dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^2 . The material time derivative of the Jacobian is most easily computed in material form, and using Cartesian coordinates: if \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) , \\begin{split} \\frac{DJ(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} &= \\frac{\\partial J(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\text{det} \\begin{bmatrix} F_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ F_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix}\\right)\\\\ &= \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{F}_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & \\dot{F}_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ F_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix} + \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} F_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ \\dot{F}_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & \\dot{F}_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix}. \\end{split} To compute \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) note that \\begin{split} \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_J}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial V_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}. \\end{split} Using the fact that \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{v}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) , we see that \\begin{split} \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)}{\\partial x_j}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_j(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_j} F_{jJ}(\\mathsf{X},t). \\end{split} Subsituting this expression for \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) in the expression for \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) derived earlier, we get, after a tedious but straightforward expansion, \\begin{split} \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} v_{1,1}F_{11} + v_{1,2}F_{21} & v_{1,1}F_{12} + v_{1,2}F_{22}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &+ \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ v_{2,1}F_{11} + v_{1,2}F_{21} & v_{2,1}F_{12} + v_{2,2}F_{22}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &= v_{1,1}\\,\\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix}F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22}\\end{bmatrix} + v_{2,2}\\,\\text{det} \\begin{bmatrix}F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22}\\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &= \\left(\\frac{\\partial v_1(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_1} + \\frac{\\partial v_2(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_2}\\right) J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\\\ &= J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). \\end{split} In the foregoing derivation, we have used the shortand notation v_{i,j} to denote \\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)/\\partial x_j , and omitted the arguments in some of the intermediate expressions to keep the notation simple. A similar but more tedious argument can be used to show that the same result holds in three dimensions too. This completes the proof of the important result: \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) . Mass continuity equation As an immediate and useful application of the expression for the material time derivative for the determinant of the deformation gradient just derived, let us derive the mass continuity equation . This will also provide a gentle segue to the balance principles that we will study later on, after completing our study of kinematics. Suppose that the mass density of the body at the inital instant of time t = 0 is given by the scalar field \\rho_0:B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R} . This means that if we consider an infinitesimal volume \\Delta V about a point \\mathsf{X}\\in B_0 , the mass contained within that volume is given by \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\Delta V . Let the mass density at time time over the region B_t = \\varphi_t(B_0) be given by the scalar field \\rho_t:B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} . At any \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , we will often write \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) for \\rho_t(\\mathsf{x}) . Suppose that \\Delta v is the deformed volume at \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) corresponding to the intial infinitesimal volume \\Delta V at \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . The mass inside the volume \\Delta v is exactly identical to the mass inside \\Delta V initially since both \\Delta V and \\Delta v contain exactly the same particles. We therefore have the identity \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\Delta V = \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) \\Delta v. Using the fact that the \\Delta v = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta V , we can write the equation above as \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X}) = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t). This equation is known as the mass conservation equation on account of the fact that it relates the initial and current mass densities. The mass conservation equation can be cast into a differential equation by taking the material time derivative of the equation \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X}) = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) . Since \\dot{\\rho}_0(\\mathsf{X}) = 0 , we see that \\begin{split} 0 &= \\frac{D(J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t))}{Dt}\\\\ &= \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) + J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\dot{\\rho}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\\\ &= J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) \\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) + J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\right)\\\\ &= J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{div}(\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)) \\right). \\end{split} In deriving this equation, we used the identity: \\text{div}(\\rho \\mathsf{v}) = \\rho \\, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v} + \\text{grad }\\rho \\cdot \\mathsf{v} . Since the determinant of the deformation gradient is always strictly positive, we arrive at the following equation: \\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{div}(\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)) = 0. This equation is known as the mass continuity equation , and is the differential statement of the mass conservation equation \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X}) = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) . Note that we can also write the mass continuity equation in terms of the material time derivative of the density field as \\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = 0. Both these forms are useful in applications. We will also present an alternative derivation of the mass continuity equation later on. Reynolds' transport theorem To conclude our discussion of time derivatives of various quantities related to the motion and deformation of a body in three dimensional space, let us consider material time derivatives of the form \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} f(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv. Here, f:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times I \\to \\mathbb{R} is a scalar field. Note that both the integrand f(\\mathsf{x},t) and the domain of integration B_t = \\varphi_t(B_0) are functions of time. The reason for studying such integrals will become evident soon. In short, we will see that all the balance principles of continuum mechanics that we will study later on will be expressed primarily in an integral form; the rationale behind this will be explained when we study balance principles in continuum mechanics. The standard procedure to evaluate the material time derivatives of time dependent integrals of the form presented above is to first pull back the integral to the reference placement using the change of variables formula for integration, and take the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian form of the integral. Let us work this out in detail: \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} f(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv &= \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_0} f(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(f(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\right)\\, dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} \\left(\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\left(\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right) \\, dv. \\end{split} In deriving the foregoing relation, we have used some of the identities derived in the context of the mass continuity equation. Remark As a simple illustration, consider an initial volume \\Omega_0 \\subseteq B_0 . Let us study the evolution of the mass contained within this volume, which is \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\,dV. At a later time t , the mass contained the in the deformed volume \\Omega_t = \\varphi_t(\\Omega_0) is given by \\int_{\\Omega_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. Since we expect this mass to be exactly identical to the mass contained in the initial volume \\Omega_0 , we expect the material time derivative of the mass contained in \\Omega_t to be zero. Let us verify this: \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{\\Omega_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{\\Omega_t} \\left(\\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right) \\, dv = 0. In the equation above, the last identity follows from the mass continuity equation derived earlier. We thus see that mass continuity equation expresses the simple idea that the mass contained an arbitrary volume of the body does not change if we follow the volume during the motion and deformation of the body. Finally, n the special case when the integrand is of the form \\rho f , where \\rho is the mass density and f is a scalar field, we can use the mass continuity equation to simplify the material time derivative of the integral as follows: \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt}\\,dv. It is left as a simple exercise to verify this. This important result is known as the Reynolds' transport theorem , and will play a key role in our study of the balance principles of continuum mechanics.","title":"Analysis of motion"},{"location":"kinematics_motion/#analysis-of-motion","text":"Our discussion of kinematics thus far has focused on the deformation of the initial placement of a body to its current placement.

We thus obtain the following relation between the spatial velocity and the spatial acceleration: \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt}. Unlike the relation between the material velocity and the material acceleration, the spatial acceleration is not the (partial) time derivative of the spatial velocity; in addition to the partial time derivative of the spatial velocity with respect to time, it also has the the convective term \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) . The physical intuition behind this expression for the spatial acceleration is that the velocity at a given point in space changes as a consequence of both a local change in velocity, and because of material convected to the considered point due to the motion of the body. Let us quickly work out the expression for the material time derivative of the velocity according to a global basis \\mathsf{e}_i of \\mathbb{R}^3 chosen by an observer.

Note It is important to note that \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} \\neq \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} in general. Many authors write the convective term of the material time derivative of the spatial velocity as \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathsf{v} in place of what we write as \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} . To avoid ambiguity, we will always use the notation \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} . For completeness, let us also note that the material time derivative of the material velocity is defined simply as the partial time derivative: \\frac{D\\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}. Notice how the same term material time derivative is used to describe the time derivative as we follow a particle for both material and spatial velocity fields. Though this terminology can be confusing, it does not cause any problems in practice since the meaning is always evident from the context. Remark Many authors use the notation \\dot{\\mathsf{v}}(\\mathsf{x},t) for the material time derivative. We will also adopt this convention at places. In terms of this notation, the relation between the spatial velocity and spatial acceleration can be written succinctly as \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\dot{\\mathsf{v}}(\\mathsf{x},t) . Note that in the case of the material velocity, the dot notation is identical to the partial derivative with respect to time. The foregoing definition of the material time derivative can be extended to both scalar and tensor fields. For instance, if \\tau(\\mathsf{x},t) \\in \\otimes^k T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 denotes a tensor field of order k , then its material time derivative is computed as \\frac{D\\tau(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\tau(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\tau(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t).

To keep the discussion simple, only the time derivatives of a few important quantities associated with the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) are considered in detail. For the purpose of this discussion, we will use two sets of bases: (\\mathsf{E}_I) for quantities associated with the initial placement B_0 , and (\\mathsf{e}_i) for the ambient three dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^3 . Note that these are chosen by a given observer. Note also that these are often identical to each other, and the distinction is retained here purely for the purpose of conceptual clarity. Let us start with the time evolution of the deformation gradient itself. The material time derivative of the deformation gradient, which is identical to its partial derivative with respect to time, is given in coordinate form as \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum \\frac{\\partial{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. It is worth reiterating that \\dot{\\mathsf{F}} stands for the material time derivative of \\mathsf{F} . The material time derivative of the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is computed similarly: \\begin{split} \\dot{\\mathsf{C}}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\sum F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J\\right)\\\\ &= \\sum \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) + F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{\\partial F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\right) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. \\end{split} Noting that \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t) = \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i , we see that \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t) = \\sum \\frac{\\partial F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i. We therefore arrive at the following expression for the material time derivative of the right Cauchy-Green tensor: \\dot{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) + \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t). The Lagrangian rate of deformation tensor \\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is defined as \\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{D\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{Dt}. To understand the physical relevance of this tensor, consider two vectors \\Delta \\mathsf{X}, \\Delta \\mathsf{Y} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . The angle between these two vectors is computed using \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\Delta\\mathsf{Y} . As the body deforms in space accoring to a prescribed motion, the inner product of the corresponding deformed vectors also evolves with time. Let us compute the rate at which this change: \\begin{split} \\frac{D(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y})}{Dt} &= \\frac{D(\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y})}{Dt}\\\\ &= 2\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y}. \\end{split} We thus see that the Lagrangian rate of deformation tensor gives us information about how the angle between two vectors in a given tangent space evolve as a consequence of deformation. As a final and non-trivial example of computing the material time derivatives related to the deformation, let us compute the material time derivative of the determinant of the deformation gradient, but this time around, in the Eulerian setting. Recall that the Jacobian of the deformation is defined as J(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\text{det }\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and t \\in I . The spatial version of the Jacobian, which we will denote as J(\\mathsf{x},t) , where \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , is defined as J(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\text{det }\\mathsf{J}(\\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}), t). Note that we are using the same symbol \\mathsf{J} for both the material and spatial versions of the Jacobian; this is largely done because of conventional practice in the continuum mechanics literature. We will now show that the material time derivative of the Jacobian, when expressed in the Eulerian form, is given by \\frac{DJ(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\mathsf{J}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). Here, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) stands for the divergence, with respect to the spatial variable \\mathsf{x} , of the spatial velocity \\mathsf{v}_t(\\mathsf{x}) . This equation will play a key role in deriving various results in the forthcoming sections; it is worthwhile working out the proof of this statement. To keep the algebra simple, let us focus on the special case of motion in a two dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^2 . The material time derivative of the Jacobian is most easily computed in material form, and using Cartesian coordinates: if \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) , \\begin{split} \\frac{DJ(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} &= \\frac{\\partial J(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\text{det} \\begin{bmatrix} F_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ F_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix}\\right)\\\\ &= \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{F}_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & \\dot{F}_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ F_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix} + \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} F_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ \\dot{F}_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & \\dot{F}_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix}. \\end{split} To compute \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) note that \\begin{split} \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_J}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial V_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}. \\end{split} Using the fact that \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{v}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) , we see that \\begin{split} \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)}{\\partial x_j}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_j(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_j} F_{jJ}(\\mathsf{X},t). \\end{split} Subsituting this expression for \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) in the expression for \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) derived earlier, we get, after a tedious but straightforward expansion, \\begin{split} \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} v_{1,1}F_{11} + v_{1,2}F_{21} & v_{1,1}F_{12} + v_{1,2}F_{22}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &+ \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ v_{2,1}F_{11} + v_{1,2}F_{21} & v_{2,1}F_{12} + v_{2,2}F_{22}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &= v_{1,1}\\,\\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix}F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22}\\end{bmatrix} + v_{2,2}\\,\\text{det} \\begin{bmatrix}F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22}\\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &= \\left(\\frac{\\partial v_1(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_1} + \\frac{\\partial v_2(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_2}\\right) J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\\\ &= J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). \\end{split} In the foregoing derivation, we have used the shortand notation v_{i,j} to denote \\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)/\\partial x_j , and omitted the arguments in some of the intermediate expressions to keep the notation simple.

This means that if we consider an infinitesimal volume \\Delta V about a point \\mathsf{X}\\in B_0 , the mass contained within that volume is given by \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\Delta V .

Since the determinant of the deformation gradient is always strictly positive, we arrive at the following equation: \\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{div}(\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)) = 0. This equation is known as the mass continuity equation , and is the differential statement of the mass conservation equation \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X}) = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) . Note that we can also write the mass continuity equation in terms of the material time derivative of the density field as \\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = 0. Both these forms are useful in applications. We will also present an alternative derivation of the mass continuity equation later on.","title":"Mass continuity equation"},{"location":"kinematics_motion/#reynolds-transport-theorem","text":"To conclude our discussion of time derivatives of various quantities related to the motion and deformation of a body in three dimensional space, let us consider material time derivatives of the form \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} f(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv. Here, f:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times I \\to \\mathbb{R} is a scalar field. Note that both the integrand f(\\mathsf{x},t) and the domain of integration B_t = \\varphi_t(B_0) are functions of time. The reason for studying such integrals will become evident soon. In short, we will see that all the balance principles of continuum mechanics that we will study later on will be expressed primarily in an integral form; the rationale behind this will be explained when we study balance principles in continuum mechanics. The standard procedure to evaluate the material time derivatives of time dependent integrals of the form presented above is to first pull back the integral to the reference placement using the change of variables formula for integration, and take the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian form of the integral. Let us work this out in detail: \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} f(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv &= \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_0} f(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(f(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\right)\\, dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} \\left(\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\left(\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right) \\, dv. \\end{split} In deriving the foregoing relation, we have used some of the identities derived in the context of the mass continuity equation. Remark As a simple illustration, consider an initial volume \\Omega_0 \\subseteq B_0 . Let us study the evolution of the mass contained within this volume, which is \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\,dV. At a later time t , the mass contained the in the deformed volume \\Omega_t = \\varphi_t(\\Omega_0) is given by \\int_{\\Omega_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. Since we expect this mass to be exactly identical to the mass contained in the initial volume \\Omega_0 , we expect the material time derivative of the mass contained in \\Omega_t to be zero. Let us verify this: \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{\\Omega_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{\\Omega_t} \\left(\\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right) \\, dv = 0. In the equation above, the last identity follows from the mass continuity equation derived earlier. We thus see that mass continuity equation expresses the simple idea that the mass contained an arbitrary volume of the body does not change if we follow the volume during the motion and deformation of the body. Finally, n the special case when the integrand is of the form \\rho f , where \\rho is the mass density and f is a scalar field, we can use the mass continuity equation to simplify the material time derivative of the integral as follows: \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt}\\,dv. It is left as a simple exercise to verify this. This important result is known as the Reynolds' transport theorem , and will play a key role in our study of the balance principles of continuum mechanics.","title":"Reynolds' transport theorem"},{"location":"local_balance_laws/","text":"Local form of balance principles The Green-Nagdhi-Rivlin theorem, in conjunction with the various localization lemmas presented earlier, allowed us to derive the balance laws associated with mass, linear momentum and angular momentum. We will now use these balance laws to develop the local version of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. We will subsequently present the Lagrangian version of all the balance principles of continuum mechanics. Eulerian form of balance principles Notice that all the discussion so far is concerned with a spatial description of the various continuum fields. We will now summarize them and cast them in a form that highlights their physical significance. Local form of the first law of thermodynamics Recall that the first law of thermodynamics for continua takes the following form: \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\left(e(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)\\,dv &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv\\\\ &+ \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da\\\\ &+ \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv\\\\ &- \\int_{\\partial B_t} h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da. \\end{split} Using the relation between the traction vector and the Cauchy stress tensor, and the Reynolds' transport theorem, we see that the first law can be written as \\int_{B_t}\\left(\\left(\\rho\\frac{De}{Dt} + \\rho (\\mathsf{a} - \\mathsf{b})\\cdot\\mathsf{v} - \\text{div }(\\mathsf{v}\\cdot\\sigma)\\right) - \\rho r\\right)dv = -\\int_{\\partial B_t} h\\,da. Note that this equation has the familiar \" volume integral = surface integral \" structure, which suggests a use of the Cauchy tetrahedron argument to localize it. A straightforward application of the Cauch localization lemma informs us that thre exists a vector field \\mathsf{q}(\\mathsf{x},t) in B_t such that for any \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t and \\mathsf{n} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) = \\mathsf{q}(\\mathsf{x},)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}. The vector field \\mathsf{q} is called the heat flux . Using the definition of the heat flux and the divergence theorem, we see that \\begin{split} \\int_{\\partial B_t} h\\,da &= \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{q}\\cdot\\mathsf{n} \\,da\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\text{div }\\mathsf{q}\\,dv. \\end{split} Substituting this in the integral form of the first law, we get \\int_{B_t}\\left(\\left(\\rho\\frac{De}{Dt} + \\rho (\\mathsf{a} - \\mathsf{b})\\cdot\\mathsf{v} - \\text{div }(\\mathsf{v}\\cdot\\sigma)\\right) - (\\rho r - \\text{div }\\mathsf{q})\\right)dv = 0. The localization lemma then allows us to express this as the following partial differential equation: \\rho\\frac{De}{Dt} + \\rho (\\mathsf{a} - \\mathsf{b})\\cdot\\mathsf{v} - \\text{div }(\\mathsf{v}\\cdot\\sigma) = \\rho r - \\text{div }\\mathsf{q}. This equation can be simplified by noting that \\begin{split} \\text{div }(\\mathsf{v}\\cdot\\sigma) &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}(v_i \\sigma_{ij})\\\\ &= \\sum v_i \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j}\\sigma_{ij}\\\\ &= \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\text{div }\\sigma + \\sigma \\cdot \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}. \\end{split} Using this in the local form of the first law in conjunction with the linear momentum balance relation, we get the following local form of the first law of thermodynamics: \\rho\\frac{De}{Dt} = \\sigma \\cdot \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} + \\rho r - \\text{div }\\mathsf{q}. Using the fact that the Cauchy stress tensor is symmetric, we can write the term \\sigma \\cdot \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} as \\begin{split} \\sigma \\cdot \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} &= \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma + \\sigma^T)\\cdot \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}\\\\ &= \\sigma \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} + (\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v})^T)\\\\ &= \\sigma \\cdot \\mathsf{d}, \\end{split} where \\mathsf{d}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , defined as \\mathsf{d}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) + (\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t))^T\\right), is the rate of deformation tensor. Using this, we obtain the final expression for the local form of the first law of thermodynamics as \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\frac{De(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{d}(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\text{div }\\mathsf{q}(\\mathsf{x},t). This is also called the energy balance equation for obvious reasons. Remark Notice how the energy balance principle does not explicitly involve the body force and spatial acceleration terms. Local form of the second law of thermodynamics Let us now turn to the second law of thermodynamics. Recall that the Clausius-Duhem inequality reads \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\eta(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv \\ge \\int_{B_t} \\frac{\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)}\\,dv - \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\frac{h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))}{\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)}\\,da. It is a straightforward exercise to localize the second law. Using the relation \\mathsf{h} = \\mathsf{q}\\cdot\\mathsf{n} and the divergence theorem, we see that \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\eta(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv \\ge \\int_{B_t} \\left(\\frac{\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)} - \\text{div }\\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{q}}{\\theta}\\right)\\right)\\,dv. The localization lemma then yields the following local form of the second law of thermodynamics: \\rho\\theta\\frac{D\\eta}{Dt} \\ge \\rho r - \\text{div }\\left(\\mathsf{q}{\\theta}\\right). This expression can be simplified by noting the following relations: \\begin{split} \\text{div }\\frac{\\mathsf{q}}{\\theta} &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\left(\\frac{q_i}{\\theta}\\right)\\\\ &= \\frac{1}{\\theta}\\sum \\frac{\\partial q_i}{\\partial x_i} - \\sum \\frac{q_i}{\\theta^2}\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x_i}\\\\ &= \\frac{1}{\\theta}\\text{div }\\mathsf{q} - \\frac{\\mathsf{q}}{\\theta^2}\\cdot\\text{grad }\\theta. \\end{split} We can thus express the local form of the second law as \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)\\frac{D\\eta(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} \\ge \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\text{div }\\mathsf{q}(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\frac{\\mathsf{q}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)}\\cdot\\text{grad }\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t). This is also known as the entropy inequality , or the dissipation inequality . Summary of balance principles We have now derived all the fundamental balance principles of continuum mechanics starting from the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Recall that we obtained these balance laws by postulating the invariance of the first and second laws of thermodynamics with respect to Euclidean observer transformations. Let us now summarize these balance principles: Balance law Local form Mass \\dot{\\rho}(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = 0 Linear momentum \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\dot{\\mathsf{v}}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\text{div }\\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) Angular momentum \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sigma^T(\\mathsf{x},t) Energy \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\dot{e}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{d}(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\text{div }\\mathsf{q}(\\mathsf{x},t) Entropy \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)\\dot{\\eta}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\ge \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\text{div }\\mathsf{q}(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\left(\\mathsf{q}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\text{grad }\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)/\\theta(\\mathsf{x},t) Remark In all the equations displayed above, an overdot represents the material time derivative . This is a convention often used in continuum mechanics. Just to reiterate, the quantity \\dot{\\rho}(\\mathsf{x},t) denotes the material time derivative of the mass density, and not the partiat time derivative of the mass density. All the balance equations displayed above can be written in the following form: \\frac{\\partial \\chi(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{div }\\phi(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\varsigma(\\mathsf{x},t). Here, \\chi is a physical field variable, \\phi is the flux associated with the field \\chi , and \\varsigma is a source term for the field \\chi . The entropy inequality can also be written in the following form: \\frac{\\partial \\chi(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{div }\\phi(\\mathsf{x},t) \\ge \\varsigma(\\mathsf{x},t). Notice the formal similarity of this inequality with that of the other balance equalities. The various field, flux and source terms are listed below: Physical variable Field Flux Source Mass \\rho \\rho\\mathsf{v} 0 Linear momentum \\rho\\mathsf{v} \\rho\\,\\mathsf{v}\\otimes\\mathsf{v} - \\sigma \\rho\\mathsf{b} Angular momentum \\mathsf{x} \\times \\rho\\mathsf{v} \\mathsf{x} \\times (\\rho\\,\\mathsf{v}\\otimes\\mathsf{v} - \\sigma) \\mathsf{x}\\times\\rho\\mathsf{b} Energy \\rho\\left(e + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}\\cdot\\mathsf{v}\\right) \\rho\\left(e + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}\\cdot\\mathsf{v}\\right)\\,\\mathsf{v} + \\mathsf{q} - \\mathsf{v}\\cdot\\sigma \\rho r + \\rho \\mathsf{v}\\cdot\\mathsf{b} Entropy \\rho\\eta \\rho\\eta\\,\\mathsf{v} + q/\\theta \\rho r/\\theta This form of expressing the balance principles is known as the master balance equation/inequality . This form is especially convenient to provide a nice physical interpretation to the balance principles. The master form of the balance principles informs us that the rate at which a continuum field variable evolves in a small volume inside the continuum is a consequence of the influx of a corresponding flux variable across the surface of the volume element, and as a consequence of an internal source term for this field variable. Remark The master form of the balance principles is especially useful for the control volume methods in fluid dynamics. Lagrangian form of balance principles Our study of the balance principles of continuum mechanics has thus far been in the Eulerian setting. When we are intereted in the mechanics of solids, it helps to reformulate the balance principles in the Lagrangian setting. The reason why a Lagrangian formulation is more useful in the study of solids is that the magnitude of the deformation is often small enough in deformation processes involving solids in comparison to that of a fluid that we can effectively tag particles based on their reference positions. Throughout this discussion, we will suppose that we are equipped with an initial configuration \\chi_0:\\mathcal{B}\\to\\mathbb{R}^3 that places the body \\mathcal{B} in the region B_0 \\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^3 . The current configuration \\chi_t:\\mathcal{B}\\to\\mathbb{R}^3 places the body at B_t \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 at the current instant of time, and \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t defined as \\varphi_t = \\chi_t \\circ \\chi_0^{-1} denotes the deformation map. Mass balance Let us start with the mass continuity equation. We studied the mass continuity equation in the context of our discussion of kinematics; let us revisit this now. Let us define the Lagrangian form of the material density, \\rho_0(\\cdot,t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R} , using the the physical requirement that the mass in B_0 is identical to the mass in B_t : \\int_{B_0} \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dV = \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. Taking time derivatives on both sides, we see that \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_0} \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dV &= \\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\left(\\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)\\,dv\\\\ &= 0. \\end{split} This informs us, using the standard localization argument, that \\frac{\\partial \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X},0) = \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X}). In the last step, the quantity \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X}) is introduced as a compact notation for \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X},0 . The Lagrangian form of the mass balance thus recovers the obvious result that the initial mass density does not evolve with time. First law of thermodynamics Let us now look at the balance of energy in integral form. This can be written in integral form, using the expressions derived earlier, as follows: \\int_{B_t} \\rho\\frac{De}{Dt}\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\sigma \\cdot \\mathsf{d} \\, dv + \\int_{B_t} \\rho r \\, dv - \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{q}\\cdot\\mathsf{n}\\,da. To cast this in Lagrangian form, we need to define the Lagrangian version of the various quantities involved. To begin with, let us define the Lagrangian version of the energy density E(\\cdot,t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R} as E(\\mathsf{X},t) = e(\\mathsf{x},t), where \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t) \\in B_t . Using this, we see that \\int_{B_t} \\rho\\frac{De}{Dt}\\,dv = \\int_{B_0} \\rho \\frac{DE}{Dt} JdV = \\int_{B_0} \\rho_0\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t}\\,dV. Notice how we have used the volume transformation rule and the mass continuity equation \\rho_0 = \\rho J in deriving this. The term in the energy equation involving the heat source can be similarly expressed in Lagrangian form as \\int_{B_t} \\rho r \\, dv = \\int_{B_0} \\rho_0 R \\, dV, where we have introduced the Lagrangian heat source term using the definition R(\\mathsf{X},t) = r(\\mathsf{x},t) . Let us now turn to the term \\int_{B_t} \\sigma \\cdot \\mathsf{d}\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\sigma \\cdot \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}\\,dv. To compute the Lagrangian version of this, begin by recalling from our discussion of kinematics that \\dot{\\mathsf{F}} = (\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v})\\mathsf{F} \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} = \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}\\mathsf{F}^{-1}. We thus see that \\begin{split} \\int_{B_t} \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{d}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv &= \\int_{B_0} \\sigma(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\,J(\\mathsf{X},t)dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\sigma(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dV. \\end{split} To understand the last step, note that \\begin{split} \\sigma \\cdot \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}\\mathsf{F}^{-1} &= \\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T\\cdot\\sigma^T\\\\ &= \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T\\cdot\\mathsf{F}^{-1}\\sigma\\\\ &= \\sigma\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}. \\end{split} Notice how the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor is used here. Let us now introduce the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor , \\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}B_0} \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: \\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t) = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\sigma(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t). Before proceeding further, let us quickly consider the Cartesian coordinate representation of the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor. If (\\mathsf{e}_i) and (\\mathsf{E}_I) are orthonormal bases of T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , respectively, then \\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum P_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,\\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, \\qquad \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sum \\sigma_{ij}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_j. The components of the first Piola-Kirchhoff and Cauchy stress tensors are related as follows: P_{iJ} = \\sum J\\sigma_{ij}F^{-T}_{jJ}. The arguments of the various quantities in the equation above are suppressed for notational convenience. Note that since \\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t) is a linear map between two different vector spaces , it is not equivalent to a tensor in the conventional sense of the term. It is sometimes called a two-point tensor . Note also that for this same reason, it doesn't make sense to Returning back to the term involving the Cauchy stress tensor in the energy equation, we see that \\int_{B_t} \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{d}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{B_0} \\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dV. There is yet another way to express this term in Lagrangian form. To derive this, note that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{d} &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} + (\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v})^T\\right)\\\\ &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}\\mathsf{F}^{-1} + \\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T\\right). \\end{split} It follows that \\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{d}\\mathsf{F} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathsf{F}^T\\dot{\\mathsf{F}} + \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T\\mathsf{F}\\right) = \\mathsf{D}, where \\mathsf{D} = \\dot{\\mathsf{C}}/2 is the Lagrangian rate of deformation tensor. Inverting this relation, we get \\mathsf{d} = \\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{D}\\mathsf{F}^{-1}. Using this in the term involving the stress tensor in the energy equation, we see that \\begin{split} \\int_{B_t} \\sigma \\cdot \\mathsf{d}\\,dv &= \\int_{B_0} \\sigma \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{D}\\mathsf{F}^{-1}J\\,dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} J\\mathsf{F}^{-1}\\sigma\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\cdot\\mathsf{D}\\,dV. \\end{split} Introducing the second Piola-Kirchhorff stress tensor \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t) = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\sigma(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t), it follows that \\int_{B_t} \\sigma\\cdot\\mathsf{d}\\,dv = \\int_{B_0} \\mathsf{S}\\cdot\\mathsf{D}\\,dV. Note that the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor can be expressed in terms of the Cartesian coordinate system introduced earlier as \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum S_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,\\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, where the component fields can be computed in terms of the Cauchy stress tensor and the deformation gradient using a procedure similar to the one employed in the context of the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor. Note that the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is symmetric: \\mathsf{S}^T = \\mathsf{S} . Let us collect together the results involving the first and second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensors that we have derived so far: \\int_{B_t} \\sigma \\cdot \\mathsf{d}\\,dv = \\int_{B_0} \\mathsf{P} \\cdot \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}\\,dV = \\int_{B_0} \\mathsf{S}\\cdot\\mathsf{D}\\,dV. In terms of the Cartesian coordinate system introduced earlier, this can be written as follows: \\sum \\int_{B_t} \\sigma_{ij}d_{ij}\\,dv = \\sum \\int_{B_0} P_{iJ}\\dot{F}_{iJ}\\,dV = \\sum \\int_{B_0} S_{IJ}D_{IJ}\\,dV. We see that there is a natural pairing between specific stress and strain rate measures: (\\sigma,\\mathsf{d}) , \\mathsf{P},\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}) and (\\mathsf{S},\\mathsf{D}) . The stress and strain rate measures in each pair are said to be conjugate to each other. This observation will turn out to be crucial when we discuss constitutive relations later on. Remark Noting that \\mathsf{D} = \\dot{\\mathsf{C}}/2 = \\dot{\\mathsf{E}} , where \\mathsf{E} is the Lagrangian strain tensor, we see that \\mathsf{P}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{F}} = \\mathsf{S}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{E}}. But note that it is not true that the rate of deformation tensor \\mathsf{d} is the material time derivative of the Eulerian strain tensor \\mathsf{e} . In fact, it can be shown that \\dot{\\mathsf{e}} = \\mathsf{d} - (\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v})^T\\mathsf{e} - \\mathsf{e}\\,\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}. It is left as an exercise to verify this. It is possible to gain some physical intuition regarding the meaning of the first and second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensors by considering the force acting on an elementary area \\Delta a with normal \\mathsf{n} centered at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t . Let \\Delta A be the elementary area at \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{x}) \\in B_0 with normal \\mathsf{N} . The force acting on the elementary area \\Delta a is given by \\sigma \\mathsf{n} \\Delta a . Using the Piola transform, namely \\mathsf{n}\\Delta a = J\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{N}\\Delta A , we see that \\sigma \\mathsf{n} \\Delta a = J\\sigma \\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{N}\\Delta A = \\mathsf{P}\\mathsf{N}\\Delta A. We thus see that the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is the force acting on an area element in the current configuration per unit referential area . To understand what the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor means in this setting, note that \\mathsf{F}^{-1}\\mathsf{P}\\mathsf{N}\\Delta A = \\mathsf{S}\\mathsf{N}\\Delta A is the force acting on the area element \\Delta A per unit referential area. The idea behind this conclusion is that if \\mathsf{t} is the force acting on the area element \\Delta a , then the pull-back of this force that yields the force acting on the area \\Delta A is given by \\mathsf{F}^{-1}\\mathsf{T} , or, equivalently, \\mathsf{t} = \\mathsf{F}\\mathsf{T} . Remark Note that it is sufficient to think of the physical content of the stress tensor in terms of the interpretation of the Cauchy stress tensor given earlier, and to view the first and second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensors as special mathematical transforms of the Cauchy stress tensor, along the lines of the foregoing calculations. Let us now turn to the final term in the energy equation, namely \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{q}\\cdot\\mathsf{n}\\,da. To obtain the Lagrangian version of this equation, let us use the Piola transform introduced in the context of area transformation rules eariler to get \\begin{split} \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{q}\\cdot\\mathsf{n}\\,da &= \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{q} \\cdot J\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{N}\\,dA\\\\ &= \\int_{\\partial B_0} J\\mathsf{F}^{-1}\\mathsf{q}\\cdot\\mathsf{N}\\,dA. \\end{split} Let us introduce the Lagrangian heat flux vector field \\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as follows: \\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X},t) = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\mathsf{q}(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t). Recall that \\mathsf{Q} is just the Piola transform of \\mathsf{q} . Remark Note that the symbol \\mathsf{Q} has been used earlier to denote an orthogonal map. In practice, the specific meaning of a symbol like \\mathsf{Q} is always evident from the context. Using this definition, we can write the heat flux term as \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{q}\\cdot\\mathsf{n}\\,da = \\int_{B_0}\\mathsf{Q}\\cdot\\mathsf{N}\\,dA. Using the divergence theorem, we see that \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{Q}\\cdot\\mathsf{N}\\,dA = \\int_{B_0} \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{Q}\\,dV. Putting all this together and using the localization principle, we finally obtain the Lagrangian form of the energy equation as \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} = \\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t) + \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X},t)R(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X},t), or, equivalently, as \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} = \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t) + \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X},t)R(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X},t). Remark Notice how the nonlinear material time derivative that appeared in the spatial formulation gets replaced by a simpler and linear partial derivative in the Lagrangian form. Linear momentum balance We have derived the Lagrangian version of the mass and energy balance equations so far. Let us now turn to the balance of linear momentum. We will need the following additional definition: the Lagrangian body force density \\mathsf{B}(\\cdot,t):B_0 \\to TB_t in the usual manner as \\mathsf{B}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{b}(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}), t). Let us now write the inegral form of the linear momentum balance as follows: \\begin{split} \\int_{B_t} \\rho \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}}{Dt}\\,dv &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho\\mathsf{b}\\,dv + \\int_{B_t} \\text{div }\\sigma\\,dv\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho\\mathsf{b}\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\sigma\\mathsf{n}\\,da. \\end{split} Note Notice that the equation above involves the inegration of vector fields. As remarked earlier, integration of vector fields is well-defined only in the Euclidean setting. Since we deal only with Euclidean spaces in this course, we are justified writing an integral equation involving vector fields as above. Let us now cast this equation in Lagrangian form using the standard procedure: \\begin{split} \\int_{B_0} \\rho_0\\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{V}}{\\partial t}\\,dV &= \\int_{B_0} \\rho_0\\mathsf{B}\\,dV + \\int_{\\partial B_0} J\\sigma\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{N}\\,dA\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} \\rho_0\\mathsf{B}\\,dV + \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{P}\\mathsf{N}\\,dA\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} \\rho_0\\mathsf{B}\\,dV + \\int_{B_0} \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{P}\\,dV. \\end{split} The localization lemma then yields the local form of the linear momentum balance equation in Lagrangian form as \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} = \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\mathsf{B}(\\mathsf{X},t) + \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t). Notice again how the time derivative on the left hand side is a simple partial derivative in sharp contrast to the nonlinear material time derivative in the spatial form of the linear momentum balance equation. Angular momentum balance Let us now look at the Lagrangian form of the angular momentum balance principle. Recall that this takes a particularly simple form in the Eulerian setting, namely \\sigma = \\sigma^T . Using the definitions of the first and second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensors, it is clear that J^{-1}\\mathsf{P}\\mathsf{F}^T = J^{-1}\\mathsf{F}\\mathsf{P}^T \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\mathsf{P}\\mathsf{F}^T = \\mathsf{F}\\mathsf{P}^T, and J^{-1}\\mathsf{F}\\mathsf{S}\\mathsf{F}^T = J^{-1}\\mathsf{F}\\mathsf{S}^T \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\mathsf{S} = \\mathsf{S}^. We thus see that the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is symmetric. Note that it doesn't make sense to talk about the symmetry or antisymmetry of the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor since as a linear map it acts between different vector spaces. Second law of thermodynamics Finally, let us work out the Lagrangian form of the second law of thermodynamics. Following the same procedure as before to define the Lagrangian version of the various scalar fields, let us define the Lagrangian entropy density N(\\cdot,t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R} and the Lagrangian absolute temperature \\Theta(\\cdot,t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R} as N(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\eta(\\mathsf{x},t), \\qquad \\Theta(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\theta(\\mathsf{x},t), where \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t) \\in B_t . The integral form of the second law, namely the Clausius-Duhem inequality, reads \\int_{B_t} \\rho\\frac{D\\eta}{Dt} \\,dv \\ge \\int_{B_t} \\frac{\\rho r}{\\theta} \\,dv - \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\frac{\\mathsf{q}}{\\theta}\\cdot\\mathsf{n}\\,da. Using the defintion of the Lagrangian version of all the quantities involved in this equation, it is straightforward to verify that this can be cast in the following Lagrangian form: \\int_{B_0} \\rho_0\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial T} \\,dV \\ge \\int_{B_0} \\frac{\\rho_0 R}{\\Theta}\\,dV - \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\frac{\\mathsf{Q}}{\\Theta}\\cdot\\mathsf{N}\\,dA. The standard localization argument then results in the following Lagrangian form of the second law of thermodynamics: \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\frac{\\partial N(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} \\ge \\frac{\\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})R(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\Theta(\\mathsf{X},t)} - \\text{DIV }\\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\Theta(\\mathsf{X},t)}\\right), or, equivalently as \\rho_0\\Theta\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial t} \\ge \\rho_0 R - \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{Q} + \\frac{\\mathsf{Q}}{\\Theta}\\cdot\\text{GRAD }\\Theta. This latter form is especially useful in applications. Summary of Lagrangian balance laws Let us now summarize the Lagrangian version of the balance principles of continuum mechanics that we just derived: Balance law Local form Mass \\dot{\\rho}(\\mathsf{X},t) = 0 Linear momentum \\rho_0 \\dot{V} = \\rho_0 B + \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{P} Angular momentum \\mathsf{P}\\mathsf{F}^T = \\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{P} \\mathsf{S} = \\mathsf{S}^T Energy \\rho\\dot{E} = \\mathsf{P}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{F}} + \\rho_0 R - \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{Q} \\rho_0\\dot{E} = \\mathsf{S}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{E}} + \\rho_0 R - \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{Q} Entropy \\rho_0 \\Theta \\dot{N} \\ge \\rho_0 R - \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{Q} + \\frac{\\mathsf Q}{\\Theta}\\cdot\\text{GRAD }\\Theta In all the equations displayed above, an overdot represents the material time derivative, which in the case of Lagrangian variables is just the partial time derivative. It is worth reiterating that the nonlinearity present in the convective part of the material time derivative in the Eulerian form of the balance laws is conspicuously absent in the Lagrangian formulation. This has significant implications on whether, and how easily, we can solve these equations when provided with the appropriate initial and boundary conditions. As before, we can also rewrite this in the form a master balance equation, \\frac{\\partial \\chi_0}{\\partial t} + \\text{DIV }\\Phi = \\Sigma, or an inequality of the form \\frac{\\partial \\chi_0}{\\partial t} + \\text{DIV }\\Phi \\ge \\Sigma, where \\chi_0 , \\Phi and \\Sigma are the Lagrangian versions of the field, flux and source variables. The master form of the balance laws are summarized in the table below: Physical variable Field Flux Source Mass \\rho_0 0 0 Linear momentum \\rho_0 \\mathsf{V} -\\mathsf{P} \\rho_0 \\mathsf{B} Angular momentum \\varphi \\times \\rho_0 V -\\varphi \\times \\mathsf{P} \\varphi \\times \\rho_0 \\mathsf{B} Energy \\rho_0 \\left(E + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{V}\\cdot\\mathsf{V}\\right) \\mathsf{Q} - \\mathsf{V}\\cdot\\mathsf{P} \\rho_0 R + \\rho_0 \\mathsf{V} \\cdot \\mathsf{B} Entropy \\rho_0 N \\mathsf{Q}/\\Theta \\rho_0 R/\\Theta Notice how the Lagrangian version of the master balance laws are significantly simpler than their Eulerian counterparts. Remark The cross product term \\varphi \\times \\mathsf{P} in the angular momentum balance law displayed above means the following: for any constant \\mathsf{C} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , (\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t)\\times\\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t))\\mathsf{C} = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t) \\times (\\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{C}). Note that \\varphi \\times \\mathsf{P} is also a two-point tensor, like \\mathsf{P} .","title":"Local balance laws"},{"location":"local_balance_laws/#local-form-of-balance-principles","text":"The Green-Nagdhi-Rivlin theorem, in conjunction with the various localization lemmas presented earlier, allowed us to derive the balance laws associated with mass, linear momentum and angular momentum.

If (\\mathsf{e}_i) and (\\mathsf{E}_I) are orthonormal bases of T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , respectively, then \\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum P_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,\\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, \\qquad \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sum \\sigma_{ij}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_j. The components of the first Piola-Kirchhoff and Cauchy stress tensors are related as follows: P_{iJ} = \\sum J\\sigma_{ij}F^{-T}_{jJ}. The arguments of the various quantities in the equation above are suppressed for notational convenience. Note that since \\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t) is a linear map between two different vector spaces , it is not equivalent to a tensor in the conventional sense of the term. It is sometimes called a two-point tensor . Note also that for this same reason, it doesn't make sense to Returning back to the term involving the Cauchy stress tensor in the energy equation, we see that \\int_{B_t} \\sigma(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{d}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{B_0} \\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dV. There is yet another way to express this term in Lagrangian form. To derive this, note that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{d} &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} + (\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v})^T\\right)\\\\ &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}\\mathsf{F}^{-1} + \\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T\\right). \\end{split} It follows that \\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{d}\\mathsf{F} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathsf{F}^T\\dot{\\mathsf{F}} + \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T\\mathsf{F}\\right) = \\mathsf{D}, where \\mathsf{D} = \\dot{\\mathsf{C}}/2 is the Lagrangian rate of deformation tensor. Inverting this relation, we get \\mathsf{d} = \\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{D}\\mathsf{F}^{-1}. Using this in the term involving the stress tensor in the energy equation, we see that \\begin{split} \\int_{B_t} \\sigma \\cdot \\mathsf{d}\\,dv &= \\int_{B_0} \\sigma \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{D}\\mathsf{F}^{-1}J\\,dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} J\\mathsf{F}^{-1}\\sigma\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\cdot\\mathsf{D}\\,dV. \\end{split} Introducing the second Piola-Kirchhorff stress tensor \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t) = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\sigma(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t), it follows that \\int_{B_t} \\sigma\\cdot\\mathsf{d}\\,dv = \\int_{B_0} \\mathsf{S}\\cdot\\mathsf{D}\\,dV. Note that the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor can be expressed in terms of the Cartesian coordinate system introduced earlier as \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum S_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,\\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, where the component fields can be computed in terms of the Cauchy stress tensor and the deformation gradient using a procedure similar to the one employed in the context of the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor. Note that the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is symmetric: \\mathsf{S}^T = \\mathsf{S} . Let us collect together the results involving the first and second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensors that we have derived so far: \\int_{B_t} \\sigma \\cdot \\mathsf{d}\\,dv = \\int_{B_0} \\mathsf{P} \\cdot \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}\\,dV = \\int_{B_0} \\mathsf{S}\\cdot\\mathsf{D}\\,dV. In terms of the Cartesian coordinate system introduced earlier, this can be written as follows: \\sum \\int_{B_t} \\sigma_{ij}d_{ij}\\,dv = \\sum \\int_{B_0} P_{iJ}\\dot{F}_{iJ}\\,dV = \\sum \\int_{B_0} S_{IJ}D_{IJ}\\,dV. We see that there is a natural pairing between specific stress and strain rate measures: (\\sigma,\\mathsf{d}) , \\mathsf{P},\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}) and (\\mathsf{S},\\mathsf{D}) . The stress and strain rate measures in each pair are said to be conjugate to each other. This observation will turn out to be crucial when we discuss constitutive relations later on. Remark Noting that \\mathsf{D} = \\dot{\\mathsf{C}}/2 = \\dot{\\mathsf{E}} , where \\mathsf{E} is the Lagrangian strain tensor, we see that \\mathsf{P}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{F}} = \\mathsf{S}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{E}}. But note that it is not true that the rate of deformation tensor \\mathsf{d} is the material time derivative of the Eulerian strain tensor \\mathsf{e} . In fact, it can be shown that \\dot{\\mathsf{e}} = \\mathsf{d} - (\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v})^T\\mathsf{e} - \\mathsf{e}\\,\\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}. It is left as an exercise to verify this. It is possible to gain some physical intuition regarding the meaning of the first and second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensors by considering the force acting on an elementary area \\Delta a with normal \\mathsf{n} centered at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t . Let \\Delta A be the elementary area at \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{x}) \\in B_0 with normal \\mathsf{N} . The force acting on the elementary area \\Delta a is given by \\sigma \\mathsf{n} \\Delta a . Using the Piola transform, namely \\mathsf{n}\\Delta a = J\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{N}\\Delta A , we see that \\sigma \\mathsf{n} \\Delta a = J\\sigma \\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{N}\\Delta A = \\mathsf{P}\\mathsf{N}\\Delta A. We thus see that the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is the force acting on an area element in the current configuration per unit referential area . To understand what the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor means in this setting, note that \\mathsf{F}^{-1}\\mathsf{P}\\mathsf{N}\\Delta A = \\mathsf{S}\\mathsf{N}\\Delta A is the force acting on the area element \\Delta A per unit referential area. The idea behind this conclusion is that if \\mathsf{t} is the force acting on the area element \\Delta a , then the pull-back of this force that yields the force acting on the area \\Delta A is given by \\mathsf{F}^{-1}\\mathsf{T} , or, equivalently, \\mathsf{t} = \\mathsf{F}\\mathsf{T} . Remark Note that it is sufficient to think of the physical content of the stress tensor in terms of the interpretation of the Cauchy stress tensor given earlier, and to view the first and second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensors as special mathematical transforms of the Cauchy stress tensor, along the lines of the foregoing calculations. Let us now turn to the final term in the energy equation, namely \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{q}\\cdot\\mathsf{n}\\,da. To obtain the Lagrangian version of this equation, let us use the Piola transform introduced in the context of area transformation rules eariler to get \\begin{split} \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{q}\\cdot\\mathsf{n}\\,da &= \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{q} \\cdot J\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{N}\\,dA\\\\ &= \\int_{\\partial B_0} J\\mathsf{F}^{-1}\\mathsf{q}\\cdot\\mathsf{N}\\,dA. \\end{split} Let us introduce the Lagrangian heat flux vector field \\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as follows: \\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X},t) = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\mathsf{q}(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t). Recall that \\mathsf{Q} is just the Piola transform of \\mathsf{q} . Remark Note that the symbol \\mathsf{Q} has been used earlier to denote an orthogonal map. In practice, the specific meaning of a symbol like \\mathsf{Q} is always evident from the context. Using this definition, we can write the heat flux term as \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{q}\\cdot\\mathsf{n}\\,da = \\int_{B_0}\\mathsf{Q}\\cdot\\mathsf{N}\\,dA. Using the divergence theorem, we see that \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{Q}\\cdot\\mathsf{N}\\,dA = \\int_{B_0} \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{Q}\\,dV. Putting all this together and using the localization principle, we finally obtain the Lagrangian form of the energy equation as \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} = \\mathsf{P}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\cdot\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t) + \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X},t)R(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X},t), or, equivalently, as \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} = \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t) + \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X},t)R(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\text{DIV }\\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X},t). Remark Notice how the nonlinear material time derivative that appeared in the spatial formulation gets replaced by a simpler and linear partial derivative in the Lagrangian form.","title":"First law of thermodynamics"},{"location":"local_balance_laws/#linear-momentum-balance","text":"We have derived the Lagrangian version of the mass and energy balance equations so far.

Let us now write the inegral form of the linear momentum balance as follows: \\begin{split} \\int_{B_t} \\rho \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}}{Dt}\\,dv &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho\\mathsf{b}\\,dv + \\int_{B_t} \\text{div }\\sigma\\,dv\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho\\mathsf{b}\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\sigma\\mathsf{n}\\,da. \\end{split} Note Notice that the equation above involves the inegration of vector fields. As remarked earlier, integration of vector fields is well-defined only in the Euclidean setting.

In other words, they are global statements of energy balance and entropy increase. What we wish to acquire is a local description of these laws. Towards this end, we will be now develop an important lemma that will prove to be very useful later on. Basic localization lemma Suppose that we are dealing with the motion of a material body \\mathcal{B} in three dimensional space, as viewed by an observer. Let B_t be the current placement of the body. Suppose further that we are given the following integral equation \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} a(\\mathsf{x},t) \\,dv = \\int_{B_t} b(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da, where a(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} and b(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} are scalar fields, and \\mathsf{c}(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to TB_t is a vector field on B_t . Note that the vector field \\mathsf{c}(\\cdot,t) is defined on the whole of B_t , even though the equation displaced above uses just the values of this vector field on the surface \\partial B_t . We are interested in deriving the local version of this integral equation. A crucial information we will need to carry out the localization process is that the integral equation is true for any sub-region of B_t . Thus, if \\Omega \\subseteq B_t is an open subset of B_t , then we will take it as given that the following equation is true: \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{\\Omega} a(\\mathsf{x},t) \\,dv = \\int_{\\Omega} b(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv + \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da. In practice, this assumption is not really a limitation since its validity stems from simple physical considerations, as we will see later. Notice how the requirement that \\mathsf{c}(\\cdot,t) is a vector field on the whole of B_t is necessary for the foregoing equation to be well-defined. To achieve the desired localization, we make use of the divergence theorem that we studied earlier: for any open \\Omega \\subseteq B_t , \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da = \\int_{\\Omega} \\text{div }\\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)],dv. Using this in conjunction with the integral equation presented earlier, we get \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{\\Omega} a(\\mathsf{x},t) \\,dv = \\int_{\\Omega} b(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv + \\int_{\\Omega} \\text{div }\\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. Taking the time derivative on the left hand side inside the integral, using techniques outlined earlier, we see that the following is true for any open subset \\Omega \\subseteq B_t : \\int_{\\Omega} \\left(\\frac{Da(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + a(\\mathsf{x},t)\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) - b(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\text{div }\\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)dv = 0. Since this is true for any sub-region \\Omega \\subseteq B_t , let us choose \\Omega to be an infinitesimally small volume centered at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t . A simple application of the mean value theorem immediately yields the following local version of the integral equation \\frac{Da(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + a(\\mathsf{x},t)\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = b(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\text{div }\\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t). Note that this is a partial differential equation that is defined pointwise, unlike the global integral equation. The process of going from the integral equation to the corresponding differential equation is known as localization . Cauchy's localization lemma We will now prove a very important result that will turn out to be veru useful in deriving the various balance principles of continuum mechanics later on. Let us consider the following integral equation \\int_{\\Omega} a(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da. Here, \\Omega \\subseteq B_t is an arbitrary open subset of the the current placement of the body B_t , a(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} is a scalar field, and \\tilde{c}(\\cdot, t, \\cdot):TB_t \\to \\mathbb{R} is a scalar field on TB_t . This just means that given any \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t and \\mathsf{v} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{v}) \\in \\mathbb{R} . In the integral equation displayed above, the quantity \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) stands for the unit normal to the surface \\partial \\Omega at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial \\Omega , as before. We will now localize this equation. Notice that we cannot directly apply the localization procedure introduced in the previous section since the surface integral involving the \\tilde{c} field is not in the right form. The Cauchy localization lemma states that under the conditions specified earlier, there exists a vector field \\mathsf{c}(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to TB_t such that \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) = \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}, for every \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t and \\mathsf{n} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . Before we look into the proof of the Cauchy localization lemma, let us note that this lemma immediately provides us with a means to localize the integral equation that we started with, as the following calculation shows: \\begin{split} \\int_{\\Omega} a(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\\\ &= \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da\\\\ &= \\int_{\\Omega} \\text{div }\\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. \\end{split} This calculation thus allows us to localize the original integral equation to obtain the following differential equation: a(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\text{div }\\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t). We thus see how the Cauchy localization lemma helps us localize certain kinds of integral equations. Let us now turn to a proof of the Cauchy localization lemma. The key idea that is exploited in the proof is the elementary fact that if a domain in B_t is shrunk to point, its volume goes to zero faster than its surface area. Let us see how this works in a more rigorous setting. For the purposes of this argument, let us consider a small volume T shaped like a tetrahdron, with one of its vertices at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , and three of its edges along the coordinate axes, as shown in the figure below. The region T is sometimes called the Cauchy tetrahedron . Let \\mathsf{n} be the normal vector to the face of the tetrahedron that intersects the three coordinate axes, as shown in the figure. We will denote this surface as \\partial T_n . The face of the tetrahedron T whose normal is -\\mathsf{e}_i will be denoted by \\partial T_i , where i = 1,2,3 , as also depicted in the figure. With these definitions in place, we see that \\partial T = \\partial T_n \\cup_{i=1}^3 \\partial T_i. Let the length of the edges of T along the directions \\mathsf{e}_1,\\mathsf{e}_2,\\mathsf{e}_3 be l_1,l_2,l_3 . It is convenient to define l = \\text{max}(l_1,l_2,l_3) . In the limit when l\\to 0 , the Cauchy tetrahedron T shrinks to the point \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t . Let us now consider the integral equation \\int_T a(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{\\partial T} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da in the limit l \\to 0 . The surface integral in this equation can be additively decomposed as follows: \\begin{split} \\int_{\\partial T} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da &= \\int_{\\partial T_n \\cup_{i=1}^3 \\partial T_i} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da\\\\ &= \\int_{\\partial T_n} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n})\\,da + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\int_{\\partial T_i} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i) \\,da. \\end{split} Let us now evaluate the surface and volume integrals in the limit l \\to 0 . Using the mean value theorem, the surface integral can be approximated as \\int_{\\partial T} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da \\simeq \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(n)},t,\\mathsf{n})\\,\\text{area}(\\partial T_n) + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(i)},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i) \\, \\text{area}(\\partial T_i). Here, \\text{area}(S) stands for the area of a surface S embedded in B_t , \\mathsf{x}^{(n)} \\in \\partial T_n , and \\mathsf{x}^{(i)} \\in \\partial T_i , where i = 1,2,3 . The volume integral can also be approximated in the limit l \\to 0 using the mean value theorem as \\int_T a(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv \\simeq a(\\xi,t) \\, \\text{vol}(T). Here, \\text{vol}(T) denotes the volume of the region T , and \\xi \\in T . Putting all these together, we see that the integral equation reduces to the following in the limit l \\to 0 : a(\\xi,t) \\, \\text{vol}(T) = \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(n)},t,\\mathsf{n})\\,\\text{area}(\\partial T_n) + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(i)},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i) \\, \\text{area}(\\partial T_i). If \\mathsf{n} = \\sum n_i \\mathsf{e}_i , then note that the areas of \\partial T_i and \\partial T_n are related, by simple geometric considerations, as n_i = \\frac{\\text{area}(\\partial T_i)}{\\text{area}(\\partial T_n)}. We therefore see that a(\\xi,t) \\frac{\\text{vol}(T)}{\\text{area}(\\partial T_n)} = \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(n)},t,\\mathsf{n}) + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(i)},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i)n_i. In the limit l \\to 0 , \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\frac{\\text{vol}(T)}{\\text{area}(\\partial T_n)} = 0, since volumes go to zero faster than surface areas. To appreciate why this is the case, note that \\text{vol}(T) \\propto l^3 , whereas \\text{area}(\\partial T_a) \\propto l^2 , where a = 1,2,3,n . Further more, the following limits hold: \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\xi = \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\mathsf{x}^{(n)} = \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\mathsf{x}^{(1)} = \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\mathsf{x}^{(2)} = \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\mathsf{x}^{(3)} = \\mathsf{x}. We thus finally obtain the following equation in the limit l \\to 0 : 0 = \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i)n_i. In the special case when \\mathsf{n} = \\mathsf{e}_i , we immediately obtain the following result: \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{e}_i) = -\\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i). We thus finally obtain the following expression for \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) : \\begin{split} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) &= -\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i)n_i\\\\ &= \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{e}_i)n_i. \\end{split} Let us now define a vector field \\mathsf{c}(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to TB_t as follows: for any \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{e}_i)\\mathsf{e}_i. It follows immediately that \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) = \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot \\mathsf{n}, thereby proving Cauchy's localization lemma.

Note that the vector field \\mathsf{c}(\\cdot,t) is defined on the whole of B_t , even though the equation displaced above uses just the values of this vector field on the surface \\partial B_t . We are interested in deriving the local version of this integral equation. A crucial information we will need to carry out the localization process is that the integral equation is true for any sub-region of B_t . Thus, if \\Omega \\subseteq B_t is an open subset of B_t , then we will take it as given that the following equation is true: \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{\\Omega} a(\\mathsf{x},t) \\,dv = \\int_{\\Omega} b(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv + \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da. In practice, this assumption is not really a limitation since its validity stems from simple physical considerations, as we will see later. Notice how the requirement that \\mathsf{c}(\\cdot,t) is a vector field on the whole of B_t is necessary for the foregoing equation to be well-defined. To achieve the desired localization, we make use of the divergence theorem that we studied earlier: for any open \\Omega \\subseteq B_t , \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da = \\int_{\\Omega} \\text{div }\\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)],dv.

Let us consider the following integral equation \\int_{\\Omega} a(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da. Here, \\Omega \\subseteq B_t is an arbitrary open subset of the the current placement of the body B_t , a(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} is a scalar field, and \\tilde{c}(\\cdot, t, \\cdot):TB_t \\to \\mathbb{R} is a scalar field on TB_t .

In the integral equation displayed above, the quantity \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) stands for the unit normal to the surface \\partial \\Omega at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial \\Omega , as before. We will now localize this equation. Notice that we cannot directly apply the localization procedure introduced in the previous section since the surface integral involving the \\tilde{c} field is not in the right form. The Cauchy localization lemma states that under the conditions specified earlier, there exists a vector field \\mathsf{c}(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to TB_t such that \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) = \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}, for every \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t and \\mathsf{n} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . Before we look into the proof of the Cauchy localization lemma, let us note that this lemma immediately provides us with a means to localize the integral equation that we started with, as the following calculation shows: \\begin{split} \\int_{\\Omega} a(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\\\ &= \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da\\\\ &= \\int_{\\Omega} \\text{div }\\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. \\end{split} This calculation thus allows us to localize the original integral equation to obtain the following differential equation: a(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\text{div }\\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t). We thus see how the Cauchy localization lemma helps us localize certain kinds of integral equations. Let us now turn to a proof of the Cauchy localization lemma. The key idea that is exploited in the proof is the elementary fact that if a domain in B_t is shrunk to point, its volume goes to zero faster than its surface area. Let us see how this works in a more rigorous setting. For the purposes of this argument, let us consider a small volume T shaped like a tetrahdron, with one of its vertices at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , and three of its edges along the coordinate axes, as shown in the figure below. The region T is sometimes called the Cauchy tetrahedron . Let \\mathsf{n} be the normal vector to the face of the tetrahedron that intersects the three coordinate axes, as shown in the figure. We will denote this surface as \\partial T_n . The face of the tetrahedron T whose normal is -\\mathsf{e}_i will be denoted by \\partial T_i , where i = 1,2,3 , as also depicted in the figure. With these definitions in place, we see that \\partial T = \\partial T_n \\cup_{i=1}^3 \\partial T_i. Let the length of the edges of T along the directions \\mathsf{e}_1,\\mathsf{e}_2,\\mathsf{e}_3 be l_1,l_2,l_3 . It is convenient to define l = \\text{max}(l_1,l_2,l_3) . In the limit when l\\to 0 , the Cauchy tetrahedron T shrinks to the point \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t . Let us now consider the integral equation \\int_T a(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{\\partial T} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da in the limit l \\to 0 . The surface integral in this equation can be additively decomposed as follows: \\begin{split} \\int_{\\partial T} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da &= \\int_{\\partial T_n \\cup_{i=1}^3 \\partial T_i} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da\\\\ &= \\int_{\\partial T_n} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n})\\,da + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\int_{\\partial T_i} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i) \\,da. \\end{split} Let us now evaluate the surface and volume integrals in the limit l \\to 0 . Using the mean value theorem, the surface integral can be approximated as \\int_{\\partial T} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da \\simeq \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(n)},t,\\mathsf{n})\\,\\text{area}(\\partial T_n) + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(i)},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i) \\, \\text{area}(\\partial T_i). Here, \\text{area}(S) stands for the area of a surface S embedded in B_t , \\mathsf{x}^{(n)} \\in \\partial T_n , and \\mathsf{x}^{(i)} \\in \\partial T_i , where i = 1,2,3 . The volume integral can also be approximated in the limit l \\to 0 using the mean value theorem as \\int_T a(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv \\simeq a(\\xi,t) \\, \\text{vol}(T). Here, \\text{vol}(T) denotes the volume of the region T , and \\xi \\in T . Putting all these together, we see that the integral equation reduces to the following in the limit l \\to 0 : a(\\xi,t) \\, \\text{vol}(T) = \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(n)},t,\\mathsf{n})\\,\\text{area}(\\partial T_n) + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(i)},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i) \\, \\text{area}(\\partial T_i). If \\mathsf{n} = \\sum n_i \\mathsf{e}_i , then note that the areas of \\partial T_i and \\partial T_n are related, by simple geometric considerations, as n_i = \\frac{\\text{area}(\\partial T_i)}{\\text{area}(\\partial T_n)}. We therefore see that a(\\xi,t) \\frac{\\text{vol}(T)}{\\text{area}(\\partial T_n)} = \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(n)},t,\\mathsf{n}) + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x}^{(i)},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i)n_i. In the limit l \\to 0 , \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\frac{\\text{vol}(T)}{\\text{area}(\\partial T_n)} = 0, since volumes go to zero faster than surface areas. To appreciate why this is the case, note that \\text{vol}(T) \\propto l^3 , whereas \\text{area}(\\partial T_a) \\propto l^2 , where a = 1,2,3,n . Further more, the following limits hold: \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\xi = \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\mathsf{x}^{(n)} = \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\mathsf{x}^{(1)} = \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\mathsf{x}^{(2)} = \\lim_{l \\to 0} \\mathsf{x}^{(3)} = \\mathsf{x}. We thus finally obtain the following equation in the limit l \\to 0 : 0 = \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i)n_i. In the special case when \\mathsf{n} = \\mathsf{e}_i , we immediately obtain the following result: \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{e}_i) = -\\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i). We thus finally obtain the following expression for \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) : \\begin{split} \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) &= -\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,-\\mathsf{e}_i)n_i\\\\ &= \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{e}_i)n_i. \\end{split} Let us now define a vector field \\mathsf{c}(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to TB_t as follows: for any \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{e}_i)\\mathsf{e}_i. It follows immediately that \\tilde{c}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}) = \\mathsf{c}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot \\mathsf{n}, thereby proving Cauchy's localization lemma.

In the first half of this chapter, we will review the elements of thermodynamics as it applies to a general system interacting with an environment. Subsetequently, we will generalize and extend these notions to make them applicable for continuum mechanics. Review of Thermodynamics The subject matter that we will review here is variously called equilibrium thermodynamics , or, more appropriately, thermostatics . The primary concern of thermodynamics is a global description of the behavior of a system interacting with an environment , possibly exchanging energy and/or mass in the process. We will formalize these notions below. One of the hallmarks of the thermodynamic description of a phenomena is its generality - it is applicable for any macroscopic phenomena. Trivia There is no better way to summarize the status of thermodynamics among other theories of physics than the introduction provided by Gerard Maugin in his book The thermomechanics of nonlinear irreversible behaviors: An introduction : \" Perhaps, after all, the wise man's attitude towards thermodynamics should be to have nothing to do with it. To deal with thermodynamics is to look for trouble. This is not the citation of a famous scientist, but the result of a deep cogitation following mere observations. Why do we need to get involved in a field of knowledge which, within the last hundred years, has exhibited the largest number of schizophrenics and megalomaniacs, imbalanced scientists, paranoiacs, egocentrists, and probably insomniacs and sleepwalkers? Is there any other field of scientific activity such as this one where, apparently, each of the bricklayers has unhesitatingly revindicated an originality that [...] we may see but with confusion. For some thermodynamicists and for their enemies as well, thermodynamics is the science of everything, so that for the second category of individuals, it is, by mere logic, the science of nothing, and thus not a science at all; and the \"everything\" is naturally seen as a sign of megalomania from which some have not escaped. [...] \" The excerpts given above should give you an idea of the effect thermodynamics can have on you if you dig deeper. In any case, keep in mind that every thermodynamicist worth their salt has their own point of view, often a very strong one! Basic definitions A thermodynamic system , or just a system , is the part of the universe that we are interested in. The rest of the universe is called the environment . The implicit understanding in this description is that the system is in contact with its environment. We also say that the system interacts with its environment. The interaction of the system with the environment is understood to be through one of two mechanisms: work and heat . Both these are special kinds of energies; the difference is that work refers a controllable form of energy, while heat refers to the part of the energy that is uncontrollable and often associated with dissipative internal mechanisms in the system. Remark An important assumption that we will make throughout this course is that all interactions are short-ranged This means that there are no long range forces in the system, or in the interactions between the system and its environment. A defining feature of the thermodynamic approach is the study of a complex system as a black box, without any detailed consideration of the microscopic constitution of the system. The system is thus described by means of measurable physical quantities called thermodynamic variables , also known as state variables . The thermodynamic variables together determine the thermodynamic state , also referred to as just the state , of the system. It is important to note, however, that there is no universal recipe to determine the thermodynamic variables to describe a system; it is contextual and depends entirely on the system being investigated. It is conventional to classify thermodynamic variables as being extensive , or intensive . An extensive state variable is one whose value is doubled if we double the system size, whereas an intensive variable is one which is independent of system size. We will see examples of these shortly. An important extensive state variable that is common to all thermodynamic systems is the internal energy , E . Loosely, put, this the internal energy of a system is a measure of the total energy that the system posseses. In addition to the internal energy, we will typically characterize the sytem by means of a finite number of extensive state variables, which we will denote as Y_1, Y_2, \\ldots, Y_n . Example As a simple example, consider a gas enclosed in cylinder, one face of which is controlled by a piston. The state variables in this case are the internal energy, volume of the cylinder, and the number of particles in the gas (in appropriate unis). Note The fact that the internal energy is an extensive variable is dependent on the assumption that all the interactions are short-ranged. In the presence of long-range interactions, the extensivity of the internal energy is not a valid assumption in general. The system is said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment if the state variables of the system do not change with time. Implicit in this description of equilibrium is the choice of a time scale with respect to which the variation of the state variables is negligible. Note The notion of thermodynamic equilibrium is distinct from the notion of mechanical equilibrium. The latter is characterized by a net balance of forces acting on the system. This is not true in thermodynamic equilibrium. In addition to the internal energy, another extensive variable that is common to all thermodynamic systems is the entropy of the system, S . The best means to gain some intuition about entropy is from statistical mechanics . For the present purposes, it is sufficient to think of entropy loosely as a measure of disorder in the system, or, equivalently, a measure of how much the energy supplied to a system degrades to a form that is unusable. Remark If you are really interested in the statistical mechanical underpinnings of the notion of entropy, you are welcome to register for the course AE 731: Multiscale Modeling of Materials . If you're tired of my lecturing and would rather prefer learning it on your own, you can consult the many excellent textbooks on statistical mechanics out there; for instance, a simple and elegant discussino of the notion of entropy from the statistical mechanical perspective can be found here . A fundamental postulate of equilibrium thermodynamics is that the entropy is a well defined function of the other extensive variables that characterize the system: S = \\hat{S}(E,Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n). This equation is called the fundamental equation of the thermodynamic system. Further, we will assume that \\hat{S} is a monotonically increasing function of E . This assumption permits us to invert the fundamental relation to obtain the internal energy E as a function of the entropy S and the other extensive variables of the system: E = \\hat{E}(S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n). Both these forms of the fundamental equation are useful in practice. The temperature of the system, T , is defined either in terms of the function \\hat{E} as T = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{E}(S,Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)}{\\partial S}, or in terms of the function \\hat{S} as \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{S}(E, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)}{\\partial E}. Both these definitions are equivalent. The temperature thus defined is also known as the absolute temperature of the system. Note that T is an intensive variable since both E and S are extensive variables. We will now briefly consider the partial derivatives of \\hat{E} with respect to the other thermodynamic variables. We define the thermodynamic driving force X_i , where 1 \\le i \\le n , as X_i = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{E}(S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)}{\\partial Y_i}. The thermodynamic driving force X_i is said to be conjugate to the thermodynamic variable Y_i . It is helpful to think of X_i as the generalized force corresponding to the generalized displacement Y_i . Suppose now that the system is in a particular state, say A , and as a consequence of its interactions with the environment, it evolves to a different state B . The path followed by the system in the space of admissible thermodynamic variables in going from the state A to the state B is called a thermodynamic process . We will particularly be interested in reversible thermodynamic processes - these have the property that the process can be localy reversed in time, and further that the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium at every intermediate state of the process. It is convenient to think of a reversible thermodynamic process as a quasi-static process - this means that the process is carried out slow enough that the system is in equilibrium at every step of the process. A thermodynamic process that is not reversible is said to be irreversible . First law of thermodynamics The first law of thermodynamics is essentially a statement of conservation of energy. Recall that the energy of a system is not necessarily constant since it interacts with the environment. But the sum of the energies of the system and the environment is a constant. We can alternatively state this is as follows: the change in energy of the system during a thermodynamic process that takes it from state A to state B is exactly equal to the energy supplied to, or, extracted from the system as a consequence of its interaction with the environment during this thermodynamic process. Since the only means by which a system can interact with its environment is through work and/or heat, we see that \\Delta E_{AB} = W_{AB} + Q_{AB}. Here, \\Delta E_{AB} is the change in the internal energy of the system as it moves from state A to state B . W_{AB} is the work done on the system by the environment durign the thermodynamic process AB , and Q_{AB} is the heat supplied to the system by the environment during the same thermodynamic process. It is important to note that \\Delta E_{AB} = E_B - E_A . In other words, the change in internal energy is simply a difference of the initial and final internal energies, and does not depend on the particular details of the path connecting the states A and B . The terms W_{AB} and Q_{AB} , on the other hand, are typically path-dependent and need a detailed specification of the path from state A to state B . The work done in moving from state A to state B can be written as W_{AB} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_{A}^{B} X_i(S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n) \\, dY_i. Here, (S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n) is an intermediate state in the thermodynamic path connecting the states A and B . Remark Notice the similarity of the expression with the expression of the work done in elementary mechanics as the line integral, along a specified path, of the inner product of the instantaneous force and the corresponding infinitesimal displacement. Second law of thermodynamics The second law of thermodynamics is more subtle law which states that the change in entropy \\Delta S_{AB} of the system as it goes from state A to state B is always non-negative, irrespective of whether the thermodynamic path AB is reversible or irreversible: \\Delta S_{AB} \\ge 0. Here, \\Delta S_{AB} = S_B - S_A denotes the total change in entropy of the system. If Q_{AB} denotes the total heat supplied to the system during the thermodynamic process AB , and if T denotes the temperature of the environment during the process AB , we can write the change in entropy \\Delta S_{AB} as follows: \\Delta S_{AB} = \\frac{Q_{AB}}{T} + \\Delta S_i, \\qquad \\Delta S_i \\ge 0. The change in entropy entirely due to the influx of heat is given by Q_{AB}/T , while \\Delta S_i denotes internal irreversible production of entropy in the system as a consequence of the thermodynamic process. The fact that \\Delta S_i \\ge 0 can be equivalently written as \\Delta S_{AB} \\ge \\frac{Q_{AB}}{T}. Remark A generalized version of this inequality, known as the Clausius-Duhem inequality , will serve as the primary statement of the second law of thermodynamics in our study of continuum thermodynamics. In the special case when the process AB is reversible, \\Delta S_i = 0 and we can write the change in entropy as follows: \\Delta S_{AB} = \\frac{Q_{AB}}{T}. Note the equality in this expression! Using this in conjunction with the first law of thermodynamics and the expression for the work done by the thermodynamic driving forces, we see that \\Delta E_{AB} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_{A}^{B} X_i(S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n) \\, dY_i + \\frac{Q_{AB}}{T}. This form of the first law is especially useful in deriving a number of equivalent thermodynamic potentials for reversible thermodynamic processes. We will define those potentials as and when we need them later on. Continuum Thermodynamics We will now introduce a thermodynamic approach to modeling continua, and formulate, in particular, the first and second laws of thermodynamics for continua. This will serve as the starting point for our subsequent study of both balance principles and constitutive behavior. Note One of the early drivers for the thermodynamic approach to continuum mechanics is the so-called rational thermodynamics school. The choice of this name is rather unfortunate, in my opinion at least; a much better name would have been axiomatic thermomechanics , but for various reasons the name rational thermodynamics survives. The most vocal proponents of this school of thought were Clifford Truesdell, Bernard Coleman and Walter Noll. One of the defining traits of this school is its axiomatic structure with a fairly large share of postulated laws for a field theoretic approach to the model the mechanical and thermal response of continua. Though a lot of the mathematics we develop in this course will look similar to the approach taken in rational thermodynamics, we will not entirely endorse the Truesdellian approach to modeling continua. There are a few important points to note in order that we can properly understand the development of a thermodynamic theory of continua as a a non-equilibrium field theory . Let us unwrap this in stages: To understand a field theory means, recall that in our review of thermodynamics, the state variables were defined for the whole system . As a simple example, consider the case of a gas in a cylinder with a piston on one end. The volume occupied by the gas is an example of an extensive state variable that is globally defined with respect to the system. Let us now consider an elastic body undergoing deformation as a consequence of external loads acting on it. We will see that the equivalent of the volume of the gas in this case turns out to be the elastic strain. But as should be clear from our study of kinematics, strain is defined pointwise, and is actually a field variable; it is not a global definition as is the case with state variables in conventional thermodynamics. What makes the situation more complicated is that the field variables exhibit both spatial and temporal variations - the strain in an elastic solid can vary over the body, and the entire strain field can evolve over time. This is a defining trait of a system that is out of equilibrium . One of the difficulties in constructing a continuum theory of such non-equilibrium processes is that even in the elementary thermodynamic case, a rigorous theory of systems out of equilibrium with the same generality and depth as equilibrium thermodynamics is not available. In practice, we get away with this problem in continuum mechanics by making a series of assumptions, whose eventual validity is decided solely based on the agreement of the predictions of the resulting theory of continua with experimental data. The most important of this is that it is possible define non-equilibrium field theoretic analogues of quantities like internal energy, entropy, and other state variables that characterize the system. Further, the laws of thermodynamics will be appropriately extended based on these non-equilibrium field variables. The modern theory of dissipative phenomena in continuum mechanics postulates additional field variables called internal variables . These are variables that cannot be controlled, but nevertheless are required to represent the non-equilibrium state of the sytem satisfactorily. We will not delve too much into the thermodynamics of internal variables in this course, primarily because we won't have enough time to cover them in the lectures. A significant issue with this (i.e. the so-called rational ) approach to thermomechanics which postulates the existence of field variables like internal energy and entropy is that there is no longer a clear means to distinguish between thermodynamic equilibrium and the extent of deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium in this framework. Nevertheless, the development to follow can be viewed as a first look at the thermomechanics of continua that provides a working approximation that works well practice. With the foregoing caveats in place, let us now turn to the generalization of the first and second laws of thermodynamics for continua. Suppose that a continuum body \\mathcal{B} occupies a region B_t \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 at the current instant of time. Let us start with the total energy E(t) of the body at the current instant of time t . This can be written as the sum of the internal energy U(t) of the body, and its kinetic energy T(t) , as follows: \\begin{split} E(t) &= T(t) + U(t),\\\\ T(t) &= \\int_{B_t} \\frac{1}{2}\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv,\\\\ U(t) &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. \\end{split} Here, \\rho is the mass density that we studied earlier in the context of kinematics, and \\mathsf{v} is the spatial velocity. The quantity e(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} is the internal energy per unit mass . To understand what this means, consider a small volume \\Delta v centered at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , the internal energy of the material in this volume is given by \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta v . Remark A useful mental picture to understand the meaning of the internal energy \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta v is obtained by picturing the material inside the elementary volume \\Delta v as consisting of a (large!) collection of balls connected by springs, as shown in the figure below: The internal energy of the material in the region \\Delta v can be understood as the sum of the potential energy stored in the springs and the kinetic energy associated with the vibration of the balls about their mean positions. The center-of-mass velocity of this spring-mass system corresponds to the spatial velocity \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) . Note that the internal energy consists of both the potential and kinetic components, though the latter is not the kinetic energy of the macroscopic continuum. This discussion can be made precise using averaging tools from statistial mechanics - this will be discussed in the companion course Multiscale Modeling of Materials . The motion of the body in three dimensional space is viewed as a thermodynamic process. Since this is a continuous-in-time process, we will be working with the rate at which the energy of the body changes, \\dot{E}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\left(e(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)\\,dv, instead of infinitesimal changes in the internal energy as in the case of conventional thermodynamics. We will now extend the first law of thermodynamics for continua as follows: \\dot{E}(t) = P_m(t) + P_h(t), where P_m(t) is mechanical power, and P_h(t) is the rate at which heat is addded to the body. To compute the mechanical power, we need to introduce two distinct kinds of forces that act on a continuum body. The first, called a body force , acts on every volume of material inside the body. The second, called a surface force , acts on the external surface of the body. Example As an example, consider the force of gravity acting on a body in a gravitational field. It is clear that every sub-volume of the body experiences a gravitational force. We thus see that gravity is an example of a body force. As an example of a surface force, suppose that we are holding a block of material in our hands. The block is held in place by the frictional forces between the hand and the block, and acts only on the associated contact surface. To formalize this notion, we introduce a body force density \\mathsf{b}(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 so that the total body force acting on a small volume \\Delta v at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t is given by \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta v . In an analogous fashion, we introduce the surface force density at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t as the vector \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)) \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , where \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) denotes the outward normal to the surface \\partial B_t at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t . This means that the force acting on a small surface area \\Delta a at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t with normal \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) is given by \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\Delta a . Using these definitions, we can write the mechanical power due to the body and surface forces as P_m(t) = \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da. Notice that the body force density is the body force per unit mass , while the surface force density is the surface force per unit area . As the final ingredient to formulating the first law of thermodynamics for continua, write the rate at which heat is added to the body is written as P_h(t) = \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv - \\int_{\\partial B_t} h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da.

Putting all this together, we can write the first law of thermodynamics for continua, \\dot{E}(t) = P_m(t) + P_h(t) , as \\begin{split} \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\left(e(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)\\,dv &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv\\\\ &+ \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da\\\\ &+ \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv\\\\ &- \\int_{\\partial B_t} h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da. \\end{split} We will develop the pointwise version of the first law for continua later on.

The primary concern of thermodynamics is a global description of the behavior of a system interacting with an environment , possibly exchanging energy and/or mass in the process. We will formalize these notions below. One of the hallmarks of the thermodynamic description of a phenomena is its generality - it is applicable for any macroscopic phenomena. Trivia There is no better way to summarize the status of thermodynamics among other theories of physics than the introduction provided by Gerard Maugin in his book The thermomechanics of nonlinear irreversible behaviors: An introduction : \" Perhaps, after all, the wise man's attitude towards thermodynamics should be to have nothing to do with it. To deal with thermodynamics is to look for trouble. This is not the citation of a famous scientist, but the result of a deep cogitation following mere observations. Why do we need to get involved in a field of knowledge which, within the last hundred years, has exhibited the largest number of schizophrenics and megalomaniacs, imbalanced scientists, paranoiacs, egocentrists, and probably insomniacs and sleepwalkers? Is there any other field of scientific activity such as this one where, apparently, each of the bricklayers has unhesitatingly revindicated an originality that [...] we may see but with confusion. For some thermodynamicists and for their enemies as well, thermodynamics is the science of everything, so that for the second category of individuals, it is, by mere logic, the science of nothing, and thus not a science at all; and the \"everything\" is naturally seen as a sign of megalomania from which some have not escaped. [...] \" The excerpts given above should give you an idea of the effect thermodynamics can have on you if you dig deeper. In any case, keep in mind that every thermodynamicist worth their salt has their own point of view, often a very strong one!","title":"Review of Thermodynamics"},{"location":"review_thermodyn/#basic-definitions","text":"A thermodynamic system , or just a system , is the part of the universe that we are interested in. The rest of the universe is called the environment . The implicit understanding in this description is that the system is in contact with its environment. We also say that the system interacts with its environment. The interaction of the system with the environment is understood to be through one of two mechanisms: work and heat . Both these are special kinds of energies; the difference is that work refers a controllable form of energy, while heat refers to the part of the energy that is uncontrollable and often associated with dissipative internal mechanisms in the system. Remark An important assumption that we will make throughout this course is that all interactions are short-ranged This means that there are no long range forces in the system, or in the interactions between the system and its environment. A defining feature of the thermodynamic approach is the study of a complex system as a black box, without any detailed consideration of the microscopic constitution of the system. The system is thus described by means of measurable physical quantities called thermodynamic variables , also known as state variables . The thermodynamic variables together determine the thermodynamic state , also referred to as just the state , of the system. It is important to note, however, that there is no universal recipe to determine the thermodynamic variables to describe a system; it is contextual and depends entirely on the system being investigated. It is conventional to classify thermodynamic variables as being extensive , or intensive . An extensive state variable is one whose value is doubled if we double the system size, whereas an intensive variable is one which is independent of system size. We will see examples of these shortly. An important extensive state variable that is common to all thermodynamic systems is the internal energy , E . Loosely, put, this the internal energy of a system is a measure of the total energy that the system posseses. In addition to the internal energy, we will typically characterize the sytem by means of a finite number of extensive state variables, which we will denote as Y_1, Y_2, \\ldots, Y_n . Example As a simple example, consider a gas enclosed in cylinder, one face of which is controlled by a piston. The state variables in this case are the internal energy, volume of the cylinder, and the number of particles in the gas (in appropriate unis). Note The fact that the internal energy is an extensive variable is dependent on the assumption that all the interactions are short-ranged. In the presence of long-range interactions, the extensivity of the internal energy is not a valid assumption in general. The system is said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment if the state variables of the system do not change with time. Implicit in this description of equilibrium is the choice of a time scale with respect to which the variation of the state variables is negligible. Note The notion of thermodynamic equilibrium is distinct from the notion of mechanical equilibrium. The latter is characterized by a net balance of forces acting on the system. This is not true in thermodynamic equilibrium. In addition to the internal energy, another extensive variable that is common to all thermodynamic systems is the entropy of the system, S . The best means to gain some intuition about entropy is from statistical mechanics . For the present purposes, it is sufficient to think of entropy loosely as a measure of disorder in the system, or, equivalently, a measure of how much the energy supplied to a system degrades to a form that is unusable. Remark If you are really interested in the statistical mechanical underpinnings of the notion of entropy, you are welcome to register for the course AE 731: Multiscale Modeling of Materials . If you're tired of my lecturing and would rather prefer learning it on your own, you can consult the many excellent textbooks on statistical mechanics out there; for instance, a simple and elegant discussino of the notion of entropy from the statistical mechanical perspective can be found here . A fundamental postulate of equilibrium thermodynamics is that the entropy is a well defined function of the other extensive variables that characterize the system: S = \\hat{S}(E,Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n). This equation is called the fundamental equation of the thermodynamic system. Further, we will assume that \\hat{S} is a monotonically increasing function of E . This assumption permits us to invert the fundamental relation to obtain the internal energy E as a function of the entropy S and the other extensive variables of the system: E = \\hat{E}(S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n). Both these forms of the fundamental equation are useful in practice. The temperature of the system, T , is defined either in terms of the function \\hat{E} as T = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{E}(S,Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)}{\\partial S}, or in terms of the function \\hat{S} as \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{S}(E, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)}{\\partial E}. Both these definitions are equivalent. The temperature thus defined is also known as the absolute temperature of the system. Note that T is an intensive variable since both E and S are extensive variables. We will now briefly consider the partial derivatives of \\hat{E} with respect to the other thermodynamic variables. We define the thermodynamic driving force X_i , where 1 \\le i \\le n , as X_i = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{E}(S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)}{\\partial Y_i}. The thermodynamic driving force X_i is said to be conjugate to the thermodynamic variable Y_i . It is helpful to think of X_i as the generalized force corresponding to the generalized displacement Y_i . Suppose now that the system is in a particular state, say A , and as a consequence of its interactions with the environment, it evolves to a different state B . The path followed by the system in the space of admissible thermodynamic variables in going from the state A to the state B is called a thermodynamic process . We will particularly be interested in reversible thermodynamic processes - these have the property that the process can be localy reversed in time, and further that the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium at every intermediate state of the process. It is convenient to think of a reversible thermodynamic process as a quasi-static process - this means that the process is carried out slow enough that the system is in equilibrium at every step of the process. A thermodynamic process that is not reversible is said to be irreversible .","title":"Basic definitions"},{"location":"review_thermodyn/#first-law-of-thermodynamics","text":"The first law of thermodynamics is essentially a statement of conservation of energy. Recall that the energy of a system is not necessarily constant since it interacts with the environment. But the sum of the energies of the system and the environment is a constant. We can alternatively state this is as follows: the change in energy of the system during a thermodynamic process that takes it from state A to state B is exactly equal to the energy supplied to, or, extracted from the system as a consequence of its interaction with the environment during this thermodynamic process. Since the only means by which a system can interact with its environment is through work and/or heat, we see that \\Delta E_{AB} = W_{AB} + Q_{AB}. Here, \\Delta E_{AB} is the change in the internal energy of the system as it moves from state A to state B . W_{AB} is the work done on the system by the environment durign the thermodynamic process AB , and Q_{AB} is the heat supplied to the system by the environment during the same thermodynamic process. It is important to note that \\Delta E_{AB} = E_B - E_A . In other words, the change in internal energy is simply a difference of the initial and final internal energies, and does not depend on the particular details of the path connecting the states A and B . The terms W_{AB} and Q_{AB} , on the other hand, are typically path-dependent and need a detailed specification of the path from state A to state B . The work done in moving from state A to state B can be written as W_{AB} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_{A}^{B} X_i(S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n) \\, dY_i. Here, (S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n) is an intermediate state in the thermodynamic path connecting the states A and B . Remark Notice the similarity of the expression with the expression of the work done in elementary mechanics as the line integral, along a specified path, of the inner product of the instantaneous force and the corresponding infinitesimal displacement.","title":"First law of thermodynamics"},{"location":"review_thermodyn/#second-law-of-thermodynamics","text":"The second law of thermodynamics is more subtle law which states that the change in entropy \\Delta S_{AB} of the system as it goes from state A to state B is always non-negative, irrespective of whether the thermodynamic path AB is reversible or irreversible: \\Delta S_{AB} \\ge 0. Here, \\Delta S_{AB} = S_B - S_A denotes the total change in entropy of the system. If Q_{AB} denotes the total heat supplied to the system during the thermodynamic process AB , and if T denotes the temperature of the environment during the process AB , we can write the change in entropy \\Delta S_{AB} as follows: \\Delta S_{AB} = \\frac{Q_{AB}}{T} + \\Delta S_i, \\qquad \\Delta S_i \\ge 0.

Remark A generalized version of this inequality, known as the Clausius-Duhem inequality , will serve as the primary statement of the second law of thermodynamics in our study of continuum thermodynamics. In the special case when the process AB is reversible, \\Delta S_i = 0 and we can write the change in entropy as follows: \\Delta S_{AB} = \\frac{Q_{AB}}{T}. Note the equality in this expression!

This will serve as the starting point for our subsequent study of both balance principles and constitutive behavior. Note One of the early drivers for the thermodynamic approach to continuum mechanics is the so-called rational thermodynamics school. The choice of this name is rather unfortunate, in my opinion at least; a much better name would have been axiomatic thermomechanics , but for various reasons the name rational thermodynamics survives. The most vocal proponents of this school of thought were Clifford Truesdell, Bernard Coleman and Walter Noll. One of the defining traits of this school is its axiomatic structure with a fairly large share of postulated laws for a field theoretic approach to the model the mechanical and thermal response of continua. Though a lot of the mathematics we develop in this course will look similar to the approach taken in rational thermodynamics, we will not entirely endorse the Truesdellian approach to modeling continua. There are a few important points to note in order that we can properly understand the development of a thermodynamic theory of continua as a a non-equilibrium field theory . Let us unwrap this in stages: To understand a field theory means, recall that in our review of thermodynamics, the state variables were defined for the whole system . As a simple example, consider the case of a gas in a cylinder with a piston on one end. The volume occupied by the gas is an example of an extensive state variable that is globally defined with respect to the system. Let us now consider an elastic body undergoing deformation as a consequence of external loads acting on it. We will see that the equivalent of the volume of the gas in this case turns out to be the elastic strain. But as should be clear from our study of kinematics, strain is defined pointwise, and is actually a field variable; it is not a global definition as is the case with state variables in conventional thermodynamics. What makes the situation more complicated is that the field variables exhibit both spatial and temporal variations - the strain in an elastic solid can vary over the body, and the entire strain field can evolve over time. This is a defining trait of a system that is out of equilibrium . One of the difficulties in constructing a continuum theory of such non-equilibrium processes is that even in the elementary thermodynamic case, a rigorous theory of systems out of equilibrium with the same generality and depth as equilibrium thermodynamics is not available. In practice, we get away with this problem in continuum mechanics by making a series of assumptions, whose eventual validity is decided solely based on the agreement of the predictions of the resulting theory of continua with experimental data. The most important of this is that it is possible define non-equilibrium field theoretic analogues of quantities like internal energy, entropy, and other state variables that characterize the system. Further, the laws of thermodynamics will be appropriately extended based on these non-equilibrium field variables. The modern theory of dissipative phenomena in continuum mechanics postulates additional field variables called internal variables . These are variables that cannot be controlled, but nevertheless are required to represent the non-equilibrium state of the sytem satisfactorily. We will not delve too much into the thermodynamics of internal variables in this course, primarily because we won't have enough time to cover them in the lectures. A significant issue with this (i.e. the so-called rational ) approach to thermomechanics which postulates the existence of field variables like internal energy and entropy is that there is no longer a clear means to distinguish between thermodynamic equilibrium and the extent of deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium in this framework. Nevertheless, the development to follow can be viewed as a first look at the thermomechanics of continua that provides a working approximation that works well practice. With the foregoing caveats in place, let us now turn to the generalization of the first and second laws of thermodynamics for continua. Suppose that a continuum body \\mathcal{B} occupies a region B_t \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 at the current instant of time. Let us start with the total energy E(t) of the body at the current instant of time t . This can be written as the sum of the internal energy U(t) of the body, and its kinetic energy T(t) , as follows: \\begin{split} E(t) &= T(t) + U(t),\\\\ T(t) &= \\int_{B_t} \\frac{1}{2}\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv,\\\\ U(t) &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. \\end{split} Here, \\rho is the mass density that we studied earlier in the context of kinematics, and \\mathsf{v} is the spatial velocity. The quantity e(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} is the internal energy per unit mass . To understand what this means, consider a small volume \\Delta v centered at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , the internal energy of the material in this volume is given by \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta v . Remark A useful mental picture to understand the meaning of the internal energy \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta v is obtained by picturing the material inside the elementary volume \\Delta v as consisting of a (large!) collection of balls connected by springs, as shown in the figure below: The internal energy of the material in the region \\Delta v can be understood as the sum of the potential energy stored in the springs and the kinetic energy associated with the vibration of the balls about their mean positions.

This discussion can be made precise using averaging tools from statistial mechanics - this will be discussed in the companion course Multiscale Modeling of Materials . The motion of the body in three dimensional space is viewed as a thermodynamic process. Since this is a continuous-in-time process, we will be working with the rate at which the energy of the body changes, \\dot{E}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\left(e(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)\\,dv, instead of infinitesimal changes in the internal energy as in the case of conventional thermodynamics. We will now extend the first law of thermodynamics for continua as follows: \\dot{E}(t) = P_m(t) + P_h(t), where P_m(t) is mechanical power, and P_h(t) is the rate at which heat is addded to the body. To compute the mechanical power, we need to introduce two distinct kinds of forces that act on a continuum body. The first, called a body force , acts on every volume of material inside the body.
