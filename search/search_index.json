In particular, we will see that all the information relevant to the change in shape of the body from the initial instant of time to the current instant of time is contained in a quantity called the deformation gradient . Deformation Let us consider, as before, a motion (\\chi_t)_{t \\in I} of a body \\mathcal{B} as it moves and deforms in the three dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^3 . Since it is much easier to deal with maps between open subsets of Euclidean spaces, our attention henceforth will almost exclusively be on the deformation map \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t , where B_0 = \\chi_0(\\mathcal{B}) and B_t = \\chi_t(\\mathcal{B}) are the initial and current placements of the body, respectively. Remark Before we proceed further, we will introduce a useful notational convention that will turn out to quite useful in the sequel. We will, for the most part, use uppercase symbols for quantities associated with the initial configuration, and lowercase symbols for quantities associated with the current configuration. This also includes the indices for components of vectors and tensors with respect to suitably chosen bases. Let us now introduce a basis for the three dimensional Euclidean space \\mathbb{R}^3 . For the sake of conceptual clarity, let us introduce two sets of bases (\\mathsf{E}_I)_{I=1}^3 and (\\mathsf{e}_i)_{i=1}^3 ; note that these are the bases chosen by a single observer. We will use the basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) to denote points in B_0 and the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) to denote points in B_t . Notice how we have used uppercase and lowercase symbols for the initial and current placements, according the convention just outlined. Remark For all practical purposes, we can identify the bases (\\mathsf{E}_I) and (\\mathsf{e}_i) of \\mathbb{R}^3 . A formal way to express this equivalence is using the equation \\mathsf{e}_i = \\sum \\delta_{iI} \\mathsf{E}_I . More generally, the bases could be related via an orthogonal matrix as follows: \\mathsf{e}_i = \\sum \\hat{Q}_{iJ} \\mathsf{E}_J , with the matrix [\\hat{\\mathsf{Q}}] whose (i,J)^{\\text{th}} entry is \\hat{Q}_{iJ} being orthogonal. Even though it is sufficient to identify the two bases for the following development, we will retain the upper and lower case notations for the purpose of conceptual clarity. Note In a more general development of continuum mechanics, the background space is itself modeled as a manifold. Since a manifold is, in general, not a linear space, the choice of a basis for space doesn't make sense in the general development. Rather, coordinates are assigned to every point on the manifold by the choice of an appropriate coordinate system. The choice of the two bases for \\mathbb{R}^3 as we have done here can be understood as the choice of two Cartesian coordinate systems, one for B_0 , and another for B_t . With this background, let us work out the coordinate representations of the deformation map. If (x_i) and (X_I) are the Cartesian coordinates of the points \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , respectively, the deformation map \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X}, t) can be written in coordinate form as follows: x_i = \\varphi_i(X_1, X_2, X_3, t), \\quad i = 1,2,3. Here \\varphi_i(\\cdot, t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R} are the component maps of \\varphi(\\cdot,t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 . We will often write this equation as x_i = \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t) . Example Consider the following deformation: x_1 = \\lambda_1 X_1, \\quad x_2 = \\lambda_2 X_2, \\quad x_3 = \\lambda_3 X_3, with \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 > 0 . This corresponds to a volumetric strain . To understand why this is the case, note that a cube of side length 1 gets transformed to a cuboid of side lengths \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 as a consequence of this deformation. Example As another example of an elementary deformation, let us consider the following: x_1 = X_1 + X_2 \\tan \\theta, \\quad x_2 = X_2, \\quad x_3 = X_3. This is an example of a pure shear . Deformation gradient We now turn to the critical notion of the deformation gradient . As remarked earlier, this quantity carries all the information that is required to characterize the deformation of the body. But in its essence, it is a very simple idea. Note that the deformation map \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t is a nonlinear function of \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . Recall that the preferred means to study general nonlinear maps is to construct their local linearized version, and study this linearized map locally. This, in particular, involves the computation of the Frechet derivative of the nonlinear map. The Frechet derivative of the deformation map is called the deformation gradient . We will use the fact that when the Frechet derivative exists, it is identical to the Gateaux derivative, and use the latter to derive the expression for the deformation gradient. At any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , choose an arbitrary vector \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 in the tangent space to B_0 at \\mathsf{X} . Consider the line \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}:[0,\\delta] \\to B_0 defined as follows: for any s \\in [0,\\delta] , \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s) = \\mathsf{X} + s\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. Since B_0 is open, it is always possible to choose an appropriate value of \\delta > 0 so as to ensure that the image of this line lies entirely in B_0 . In the limit when \\delta \\to 0 , the material curve \\chi_0^{-1} \\circ \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}:[0,\\delta] \\to \\mathcal{B} is called an infinitesimal material line segment . It follows from a simple calculation that \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s) = \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. This just expresses the fact that the tangent vector to the curve \\bar{\\mathsf{X}} at \\mathsf{X} is \\Delta\\mathsf{X} . As a consequence of the deformation, the line \\bar{\\mathsf{X}} gets deformed to the line \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}:[0,\\delta] \\to B_t , where, for any s \\in [0,\\delta] , \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}(s) = \\varphi_t(\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s)). We will use the notation \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t to denote the tangent vector to the deformed curve \\bar{\\mathsf{x}} at \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) . We will now define the deformation gradient at \\mathsf{X} as the map \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t that maps the tangent vector \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 to the tangent vector \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_t : \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. To compute the expression for the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) in terms of the deformation map, note that \\begin{split} \\Delta \\mathsf{x} &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}(s)\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\varphi_t(\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s))\\\\ &= \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s)\\\\ &= \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. \\end{split} For reasons that will become clear later on, we will introduce a new notation: \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\text{GRAD } \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. Remark Notice that we dropped the generalized dot product in \\nabla\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{X} in writing it as \\text{GRAD }\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})\\Delta\\mathsf{X} . This is to due to the fact that the deformation gradient is actually the Frechet derivative of the deformation map. As long as we are working in Euclidean spaces, this distinction isn't really important. We will therefore write the action of the deformation map \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) on \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as follows: \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\text{GRAD } \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\Delta\\mathsf{X}. Since the deformationg gradient maps tangent vectors to curves in the initial placement to tangent vectors to curves in the current placement, it is also called as the tangent map of the deformation. Remark The symbol \\text{GRAD }\\cdot stands for the gradient operation with respect to the coordinate system chosen on B_0 . The uppercase notation is chosen to be consistent with the notational convention we chose earlier. Let us work out the coordinate representation of the deformation gradient. Since we are working within a Cartesian coordinate setting, we can choose the same basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) for all the tangent spaces of B_0 , and the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) for all the tangent spaces of B_t . If \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\sum \\Delta x_i \\mathsf{e}_i, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\sum \\Delta X_I \\mathsf{E}_I, then it follows from a straightforward calculation that \\Delta x_i = \\sum F_{iI}\\Delta X_I = \\sum \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_I} \\Delta X_I. The coordinate representation of the deformation gradient follows immediately as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, where F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}. We will at times use the shorthand notation F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\varphi_{i,J}(\\mathsf{X},t) to write this equation. Note that the components of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) can be arranged into a matrix [\\mathsf{F}] whose (i,J)^{\\text{th}} entry is F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) . In terms of this matrix, we see that \\begin{bmatrix} \\Delta x_1\\\\ \\Delta x_2\\\\ \\Delta x_3\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} F_{11} & F_{12} & F_{13}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22} & F_{23}\\\\ F_{31} & F_{32} & F_{33} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\Delta X_1\\\\ \\Delta X_2\\\\ \\Delta X_3\\end{bmatrix}, or, in a much more concise form, [\\Delta \\mathsf{x}] = [\\mathsf{F}][\\Delta\\mathsf{X}] . Let us quickly look into the physical meaning of the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . Suppose that \\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{X}' \\in B_0 are two neighboring points, and let \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{X}' - \\mathsf{X} . Let the corresponding points in the current placement be \\mathsf{x}, \\mathsf{x}' \\in B_t , and let \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{x} - \\mathsf{x}' . In the limit when the line joining \\mathsf{X} and \\mathsf{X}' in B_0 corresponds to an infinitesimal material line segment in \\mathcal{B} , it follows from a simple application of Taylor's theorem that \\begin{split} x'_i &= \\varphi_i(X'_1, X'_2, X'_3, t)\\\\ &= \\varphi_i(X_1 + \\Delta X_1, X_2 + \\Delta X_2, X_3 + \\Delta X_3, t)\\\\ &= \\varphi_i(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) + \\sum \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(X_1,X_2,X_3,t)}{\\partial X_I} \\Delta X_I + o(\\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X}\\rVert^2). \\end{split} Rearranging this, we see that \\Delta x_i \\simeq \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta X_I. The deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) thus tells us how two neighboring points in the initial placement get relatively deformed as a consequence of the deformation. Remark In the derivation above, o(\\cdot) stands for the little 'o' symbol. This is defined as follows: given functions f, g:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} , we say that f = o(g) at x_* \\in \\mathbb{R} if it is true that \\lim_{x \\to x_*} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0. The extension to higher dimensional functions is similarly defined. Let us know revisit the examples we studied in the previous section and compute their deformation gradient Example For the case of a volumetric strain deformation with x_1 = \\lambda_1 X_1 , x_2 = \\lambda_2 X_2 and x_3 = \\lambda_3 X_3 , it follows from a simple computation that F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum \\lambda_i \\delta_{iJ} \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. In matrix form, [\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)] = \\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{bmatrix}. It is a good idea to relate this deformation gradient to the effect the volumetric strain deformation has on a unit cube. Example Let us consider the example of pure shear, with x_1 = X_1 + \\tan \\theta X_2 , x_2 = X_2 and x_3 = X_3 . It follows from a straightforward calculation that [\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, where s = \\tan \\theta denotes the amount of shear. Note that the deformation gradient can be equivalenlty written as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{I} + s \\mathsf{e}_1 \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_2. Here, \\mathsf{I}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t is the identity map that maps the basis (E_I) of T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 to the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) of T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . In practice, we will often have a few other restrictions on the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . In particular, we will always assume that the deformation gradient is invertible. This implies, in particular that the determinant of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) is non-zero. We will, in fact, show shortly that for physically admissible deformations, \\text{det}(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)) > 0 . We will therefore assume in the sequel the existence of the inverse deformation map \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Length transformation Let us now see how the length of an infinitesimal line element changes as a consequence of deformation. In what follows, we will identify, as in the preceeding discussions, an infinitesimal line element with an element of the appropriate tangent space. Thus, suppose that the vector \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is mapped to \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t by the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . It follows from a simple calculation that \\begin{split} \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x}\\rVert^2 &= \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= (\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot (\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X})\\\\ &= \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}, \\end{split} where \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t) . Note that \\mathsf{F}^T:T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . We now introduce the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t). Remark Many engineering textbooks write the foregoing equation as \\mathsf{C} = \\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} . We will adopt such a simplified notation when it suits our needs. But it should always be kept in mind what such shorthand notations actually mean. In terms of the bases (\\mathsf{E}_I) and (\\mathsf{e}_i) of the respective tangent spaces, it follows from a simple calculation that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i,\\\\ \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. \\end{split} Remark It is instructive to pause here and reflect on the mathematical difference between the quantities \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Both these are linear maps, and can be converted into tensors on the product spaces T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\otimes T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\otimes T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , respectively. Notice how the definition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) involves two distinct vector spaces, while \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) depends only on one vector space. For this reason, \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called a two-point tensor , while \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) is a tensor in the usual sense of the term as we studied earlier. Returning to our discussion of the change in the length of an infinitesimal line segment as a consequence of deformation, it follows from the developments so far that \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 = \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\left(\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}, where \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Introducing the Green-Lagrange strain tensor , also called the Lagrangian strain tensor , \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right), we see that the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment can be expressed in terms of the Lagrangian strain tensor as \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 = 2\\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. We thus see that the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment is dictated by the Lagrangian strain tensor. In terms of the basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) of T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , it is straightfoward to verify that \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, \\qquad E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(C_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\delta_{IJ}\\right). Here, C_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) are the components of the right Cauchy-Green tensor, and \\delta_{IJ} is the Kronecker delta symbol. The diagonal component fields E_{II}(\\mathsf{X},t) are called axial , or tensile strains, while the off-diagonal component fields E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) , with I \\neq J are called shear strains. The preceeding discussion allowed us to study the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment in the Lagrangian description. Alternatively, we can describe the same phenomena from the Eulerian viewpoint. Following the same line of thought as above, we see that \\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. Defining the left Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t), where \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) , it follows that \\begin{split} \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X} &= \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{b}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. \\end{split} The Eulerian strain tensor , also called the Almansi strain tensor , is the map \\mathsf{e}:T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t defined as follows: \\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right). Here, \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . Using these definitions, we can now compute the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment in the Eulerian description as follows: \\begin{split} \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 &= \\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{x} - \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{b}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= 2\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. \\end{split} It is important to note the following identity: \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2\\right) = \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. Thus, the same physical phenomena can be expressed in two complementary viewpoints. It is however important to develop concrete relations like the one above that express the mutual compatibility of such distinct but equivalent descriptions. Example We would intuitively expect a body undergoing a pure translation or a pure rotation to have zero strain since the relative positions of the body do not change under these kinds of deformations. Let us verify this. Suppose that we are given a deformation \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t of the following form: for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) = \\mathsf{c} + \\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X} - \\mathsf{O}), where \\mathsf{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is a constant vector, and \\mathsf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is some fixed point in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Further, we will assume that the constant map \\mathsf{Q}:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 is orthogonal. With these assumptions, it is clear that this denotes a deformation consisting of a rotation according to the rotation map \\mathsf{Q} about the point \\mathsf{O} followed by a uniform translation \\mathsf{c} . It is left as a straightforward exercise to compute that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{Q}, and, consequently, that \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{0} , and \\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{0} . We thus see that the definition of strain that we have developed is consistent with our intuitive sense of how a strain ought to behave. Once we know how an infinitesimal line element changes in length as a consequence of deformation, the change in length of an arbitrary curve in the initial placement can be computed. Specifically, suppose that \\gamma:I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} \\to B_0 is a curve in B_0 . The length of this curve, L_\\gamma is computed as follows: L_{\\gamma} = \\int_I \\lVert D\\gamma(t)\\rVert dt. Remark It is not difficult to show that the length thus defined is independent of the parametrization of the curve. Indeed, suppose that there exists a smooth, monotonically increasing and surjective function \\tau:I \\to J \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} such that we can formulate an alternative parametrization of the line \\gamma(I) as the curve \\tilde{\\gamma}:J \\to B_0 as follows: \\tilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma \\circ \\tau^{-1} . Let \\tilde{L}_\\gamma denote the length of the curve \\tilde\\gamma ; we expect, based on the fact that \\gamma(I) = \\tilde{\\gamma}(J) that \\tilde{L}_\\gamma = L_\\gamma . Let us verify this: \\begin{split} L_\\gamma &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\gamma(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D(\\tilde\\gamma \\circ \\tau)(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\tilde\\gamma(\\tau(t))\\rVert D\\tau(t) dt\\\\ &= \\int_J \\lVert D\\tilde\\gamma(s) \\rVert ds\\\\ &= \\tilde{L}_\\gamma. \\end{split} In deriving this equation, use has been made of the fact that D\\tau(t) > 0 for every t \\in I . We now wish to find the length l_{\\gamma} of the deformed curve \\varphi_t \\circ \\gamma: I \\to B_t . This follows at once from the following calculation: \\begin{split} l_\\gamma &= \\int_I \\lVert D(\\varphi_t \\circ \\gamma)(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\varphi(\\gamma(t), t) D\\gamma(t)\\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\sqrt{\\mathsf{F}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t)} \\,dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\sqrt{D\\gamma(t) \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t)} \\,dt. \\end{split} We thus see that a knowledge of the deformation gradient allows us to compute the lengths of any curve in the initial placement. Volume transformation Let us now study how a volume of space occupied by the body at the initial time changes as a consequence of the deformation. Towards that end, we will first find out how an infinitesimal volume transforms as a consequence of deformation, and use this information to compute the change in volume of an arbitray initial volume. Consider three curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3:[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon] \\to B_0 such that \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(0) = \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(0) = \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(0) = \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . Let us consider the scalar triple product \\Delta V = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(s) \\times \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(s) of the tangent vectors to these curves at \\mathsf{X} . We will implicitly assume that the tangent vectors to the chosen curves at \\mathsf{X} are non-collinear. The scalar triple product \\Delta V is called an infinitesimal volume element . Note that that \\Delta V \\in \\mathbb{R} . We wish to study how the scalar triple product, \\Delta v \\in \\mathbb{R} , of the tangents corresponding deformed curves, \\hat{x}_i = \\varphi_t \\circ \\hat{X}_i:[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon] \\to B_t , i = 1,2,3 , at \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\in B_t is related to \\Delta V . This relationship is easily computed: \\begin{split} \\Delta v &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{x}}_1(s) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{x}}_2(s) \\times \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{x}}_3(s)\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\varphi_t \\circ \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\varphi_t \\circ \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(s) \\times \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\varphi_t \\circ \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(s)\\\\ &= \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(s) \\times \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(s)\\\\ &= \\text{det}(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t))\\,\\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(s) \\times \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(s)\\\\ &= \\text{det}(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t))\\,\\Delta V. \\end{split} In deriving this expression, we have made use of the chain rule of differentiation, and the definition of the determinant of a linear map in terms of volume forms. Introducing the Jacobian J(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\text{det}(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)), we can succinctly write the transformation rule for infinitesimal volume elements as follows: \\Delta v = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta V. Again, notice how a knowledge of the deformation gradient is sufficient to compute how volumes transform. If \\Omega \\subseteq B_0 is some sub-region of B_0 , we can compute the volume V_\\Omega occupied by the region \\Omega using the integral V_\\Omega = \\int_\\Omega dV. Here the integral is to be understood as the standard triple integral used to compute volumes in \\mathbb{R}^3 . As a consequence of deformation, the region \\Omega gets transformed to \\varphi_t(\\Omega) \\subseteq B_t . The volume v_\\Omega of this deformed region can be computed as v_\\Omega = \\int_{\\varphi_t(\\Omega)} dv. Employing the standard change of variables rules for integration, we can transform this volume integral over \\varphi_t(\\Omega) to an integral over \\Omega : v_\\Omega = \\int_\\Omega J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, dV. Notice the similarity between this and the transformation rule for infinitesimal volumes derived eariler. Area transformation Finally, let us consider how infinitesimal area elements transform as a consequence of deformation. The starting point is the volume transformation rule that we studied earlier. Suppose that we have three curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3:[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon] \\to B_0 such that \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(0) = \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(0) = \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(0) = \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , such that their tangents are non-collinear at \\mathsf{X} , as before. Let us now consider an infinitesimal area element \\Delta A \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , defined as follows: \\Delta A = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(s) \\times \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(s). Without loss of generality, we will suppose that the curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2,\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3 are fixed, but \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1 is arbitrary, as long as the tangents of these curves at \\mathsf{X} are not collinear. With this definition, we can write the infinitesimal volume element \\Delta V at \\mathsf{X} defined by the curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3 as \\Delta V = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta A. As a consequence of deformation, the infinitesimal volume element \\Delta V gets transformed to the volume element \\Delta v , and the infinitesimal area element \\Delta A gets transformed to \\Delta a \\in T_{\\mathsf{\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})}}B_t . Using the transformation rule \\Delta v = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta V for volume elements, we see that \\begin{split} J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta A &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{x}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta a\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\varphi_t \\circ \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta a\\\\ &= \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta a\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}), t)\\Delta a. \\end{split} Since the curve \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1 is arbitrary, we see at once that J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\Delta A = \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}), t) \\Delta a. We obtain the transformation rule for areas after a simple rearrangement of this equation as \\Delta a = J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta A. It is worth keeping in mind that \\Delta a \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and \\Delta A \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , where \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) . To conclude this section, let us look at how the area transformation rule is typically applied in practice. Suppose that we are give a vector field \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t) on B_t . The flux F_{\\mathsf{w}} associated with this vector field is typically computed as F_{\\mathsf{w}} = \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, da, where \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) is the outward normal to B_t at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t . We can compute the flux associated with this vector field equivalently by evaluating the integral over the initial placement B_0 : F_{\\mathsf{w}} = \\int_{\\partial B_0} J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, \\mathsf{w}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{N}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, dA. Notice how the area transformation rule derived earlier for infinitesimal volumes, \" \\mathsf{n}da = J\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{N}dA \", is used in writing the foregoing equation. Defining the Piola transform of the vector field \\mathsf{w} on B_t as the vector field \\mathsf{W} on B_0 , where, for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , \\mathsf{W}(\\mathsf{X},t) = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)\\mathsf{w}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t), we see that \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da = \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{W}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{N}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dA. This formula will prove to be quite useful to us later on. Remark Note that all the area integrals encountered here are to be understood in the sense of the integrals of parametrized surfaces, as was studied earlier. Polar decomposition theorem The previous sections illustrate the fact that all the relevant information regarding the change in shape of a body as a consequence of a deformation is captured by the deformation gradient. We will now study a very important decomposition of the deformation gradient that will prove to be very useful later on. The basic idea is very simple: a deformation characterized by a pure rotation does not produce any strain; hence, if we are interested in the strain caused by a general deformation, can we extract out its purely rotational components so that we are left with only that part of the deformation that is responsible for an actual shape change? The polar decomposition theorem provides a means to effect this decomposition in a precise manner. Specifically, this theorem states that any deformation graident can be decomposed uniquely as either a pure stretch followed by a pure rotation, or a pure rotation followed by a pure stretch. Specifically, given a deformation \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t , the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , where \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , and \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\in B_t , can be decomposed uniquely as follows: \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t), where \\mathbf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t is an orthogonal map, called the rotation map , that quantifies the purely rotational part of the deformation gradient, and \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 and \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t are symmetric and positive definite tensors, called the right stretch tensor and the left stretch tensor , respectively. The decomposition \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called the right polar decomposition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) , and \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called the left polar decomposition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . The proof of the polar decomposition theorem is quite simple. To begin with, notice that the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is both symmetric and positive definite. The symmetric of \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) follows from the fact that \\mathsf{C}^T(\\mathsf{X},t) = (\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t))^T = \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t). The positive definiteness of \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) follows from the fact that for any \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\lVert \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X}\\rVert^2 \\ge 0. Further, it follows from the same argument that \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = 0 iff \\Delta X = \\mathsf{0} . Recall from our discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors that since \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) is symmetric and positive definite, we can compute its square root. Define the tensor \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as follows: \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sqrt{\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)}. It follows from the definition that \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) is both symmetric and positive definite. Define the map \\mathsf{R}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0\\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}^{-1}(\\mathsf{X},t). It is easy to check that the map \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is an orthogonal map. Indeed, note that \\mathsf{R}^T\\mathsf{R} = \\mathsf{U}^{-T}\\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F}\\mathsf{U} = \\mathsf{U}^{-1}\\mathsf{U}^2\\mathsf{U} = \\mathsf{I}, where \\mathsf{I}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is the identity tensor on T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Note that we have suppressed the arguments of the various maps to keep the notation simple. A similar argument shows that \\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{R}^T = \\mathsf{I} , where \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . This shows that \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is an orthogonal map. We have thus shown that the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) can be written as the action of a symmetric tensor followed by the action of a rotation map. We still need to show that this decomposition is unique. Towards this end, suppose that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) also admits another right polar decomposition of the form \\mathsf{F} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} , where, in the interest of notational simplicity, we have suppressed the arguments of the various maps. It follows from the following argument, \\mathsf{U}^2 = \\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}}^T\\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}}^2, that \\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} . This, along with the equation \\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} shows that \\mathsf{R} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}} , thereby establishing the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition. To prove the left decomposition, define the tensor \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: V(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sqrt{\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)}, where \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) is the left Cauchy-Green tensor. It is easily checked that \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t) is both symmetric and positive definite. It follows from an argument analogous to the previous one that the map \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t defined as S(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t), is orthogonal. We thus see that the the deformation gradient can be written in the left polar decomposition form as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{S},t) . We will now show that \\mathsf{S} \\equiv \\mathsf{R} . To see this, note that we can use the orthogonality of \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t) in the following way: \\mathsf{F} = \\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} = (\\mathsf{S}\\mathsf{S}^T)\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} = \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{S}^T\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S}). Notice now that since \\mathsf{S} is orthogonal, and \\mathsf{S}^T\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} is symmetric and positive definite, it follows from the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t),\\\\ \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\mathsf{R}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t). \\end{split} We have thus shown that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) , which this the left polar decomposition. The uniqueness of the left polar decomposition follows from an argument analogous to that of the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition. This completes the proof of the polar decomposition theorem. As a quick consistency check, let us see compute the Lagrangian strain tensor using the polar decomposition theorem: \\mathsf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} - \\mathsf{I}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathsf{U}^2 - \\mathsf{I}). We have suppressed the arguments for notational convenience. We thus see that the rotation map \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) does not contribute to the strain, as expected. A similar caculation shows that this is true for the Eulerian strain tensor too. The strain is entirely captured by the right and left stretch tensors \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) and \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t) , respectively. In this context, it is useful to mention that the eigenvalues of the right and left stretch vectors are called the right principal stretches and left principal stretches , respectively.","title":"Analysis of deformation"},{"location":"kinematics_deformation/#analysis-of-deformation","text":"We will now study the deformation of the body at fixed instant of time, say the current time instant t . In particular, we will see that all the information relevant to the change in shape of the body from the initial instant of time to the current instant of time is contained in a quantity called the deformation gradient .","title":"Analysis of Deformation"},{"location":"kinematics_deformation/#deformation","text":"Let us consider, as before, a motion (\\chi_t)_{t \\in I} of a body \\mathcal{B} as it moves and deforms in the three dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^3 . Since it is much easier to deal with maps between open subsets of Euclidean spaces, our attention henceforth will almost exclusively be on the deformation map \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t , where B_0 = \\chi_0(\\mathcal{B}) and B_t = \\chi_t(\\mathcal{B}) are the initial and current placements of the body, respectively. Remark Before we proceed further, we will introduce a useful notational convention that will turn out to quite useful in the sequel. We will, for the most part, use uppercase symbols for quantities associated with the initial configuration, and lowercase symbols for quantities associated with the current configuration. This also includes the indices for components of vectors and tensors with respect to suitably chosen bases. Let us now introduce a basis for the three dimensional Euclidean space \\mathbb{R}^3 . For the sake of conceptual clarity, let us introduce two sets of bases (\\mathsf{E}_I)_{I=1}^3 and (\\mathsf{e}_i)_{i=1}^3 ; note that these are the bases chosen by a single observer. We will use the basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) to denote points in B_0 and the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) to denote points in B_t . Notice how we have used uppercase and lowercase symbols for the initial and current placements, according the convention just outlined. Remark For all practical purposes, we can identify the bases (\\mathsf{E}_I) and (\\mathsf{e}_i) of \\mathbb{R}^3 . A formal way to express this equivalence is using the equation \\mathsf{e}_i = \\sum \\delta_{iI} \\mathsf{E}_I . More generally, the bases could be related via an orthogonal matrix as follows: \\mathsf{e}_i = \\sum \\hat{Q}_{iJ} \\mathsf{E}_J , with the matrix [\\hat{\\mathsf{Q}}] whose (i,J)^{\\text{th}} entry is \\hat{Q}_{iJ} being orthogonal. Even though it is sufficient to identify the two bases for the following development, we will retain the upper and lower case notations for the purpose of conceptual clarity. Note In a more general development of continuum mechanics, the background space is itself modeled as a manifold. Since a manifold is, in general, not a linear space, the choice of a basis for space doesn't make sense in the general development. Rather, coordinates are assigned to every point on the manifold by the choice of an appropriate coordinate system. The choice of the two bases for \\mathbb{R}^3 as we have done here can be understood as the choice of two Cartesian coordinate systems, one for B_0 , and another for B_t . With this background, let us work out the coordinate representations of the deformation map. If (x_i) and (X_I) are the Cartesian coordinates of the points \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , respectively, the deformation map \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X}, t) can be written in coordinate form as follows: x_i = \\varphi_i(X_1, X_2, X_3, t), \\quad i = 1,2,3. Here \\varphi_i(\\cdot, t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R} are the component maps of \\varphi(\\cdot,t):B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 . We will often write this equation as x_i = \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t) . Example Consider the following deformation: x_1 = \\lambda_1 X_1, \\quad x_2 = \\lambda_2 X_2, \\quad x_3 = \\lambda_3 X_3, with \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 > 0 . This corresponds to a volumetric strain . To understand why this is the case, note that a cube of side length 1 gets transformed to a cuboid of side lengths \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 as a consequence of this deformation. Example As another example of an elementary deformation, let us consider the following: x_1 = X_1 + X_2 \\tan \\theta, \\quad x_2 = X_2, \\quad x_3 = X_3. This is an example of a pure shear .","title":"Deformation"},{"location":"kinematics_deformation/#deformation-gradient","text":"We now turn to the critical notion of the deformation gradient . As remarked earlier, this quantity carries all the information that is required to characterize the deformation of the body. But in its essence, it is a very simple idea. Note that the deformation map \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t is a nonlinear function of \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . Recall that the preferred means to study general nonlinear maps is to construct their local linearized version, and study this linearized map locally. This, in particular, involves the computation of the Frechet derivative of the nonlinear map. The Frechet derivative of the deformation map is called the deformation gradient . We will use the fact that when the Frechet derivative exists, it is identical to the Gateaux derivative, and use the latter to derive the expression for the deformation gradient. At any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , choose an arbitrary vector \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 in the tangent space to B_0 at \\mathsf{X} . Consider the line \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}:[0,\\delta] \\to B_0 defined as follows: for any s \\in [0,\\delta] , \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s) = \\mathsf{X} + s\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. Since B_0 is open, it is always possible to choose an appropriate value of \\delta > 0 so as to ensure that the image of this line lies entirely in B_0 . In the limit when \\delta \\to 0 , the material curve \\chi_0^{-1} \\circ \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}:[0,\\delta] \\to \\mathcal{B} is called an infinitesimal material line segment . It follows from a simple calculation that \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0}\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s) = \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. This just expresses the fact that the tangent vector to the curve \\bar{\\mathsf{X}} at \\mathsf{X} is \\Delta\\mathsf{X} . As a consequence of the deformation, the line \\bar{\\mathsf{X}} gets deformed to the line \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}:[0,\\delta] \\to B_t , where, for any s \\in [0,\\delta] , \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}(s) = \\varphi_t(\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s)). We will use the notation \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t to denote the tangent vector to the deformed curve \\bar{\\mathsf{x}} at \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) . We will now define the deformation gradient at \\mathsf{X} as the map \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t that maps the tangent vector \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 to the tangent vector \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_t : \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. To compute the expression for the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) in terms of the deformation map, note that \\begin{split} \\Delta \\mathsf{x} &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\bar{\\mathsf{x}}(s)\\\\ &= \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\varphi_t(\\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s))\\\\ &= \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\bar{\\mathsf{X}}(s)\\\\ &= \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. \\end{split} For reasons that will become clear later on, we will introduce a new notation: \\nabla \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\text{GRAD } \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\Delta \\mathsf{X}. Remark Notice that we dropped the generalized dot product in \\nabla\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{X} in writing it as \\text{GRAD }\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})\\Delta\\mathsf{X} . This is to due to the fact that the deformation gradient is actually the Frechet derivative of the deformation map. As long as we are working in Euclidean spaces, this distinction isn't really important. We will therefore write the action of the deformation map \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) on \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as follows: \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\text{GRAD } \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\Delta\\mathsf{X}. Since the deformationg gradient maps tangent vectors to curves in the initial placement to tangent vectors to curves in the current placement, it is also called as the tangent map of the deformation. Remark The symbol \\text{GRAD }\\cdot stands for the gradient operation with respect to the coordinate system chosen on B_0 . The uppercase notation is chosen to be consistent with the notational convention we chose earlier. Let us work out the coordinate representation of the deformation gradient. Since we are working within a Cartesian coordinate setting, we can choose the same basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) for all the tangent spaces of B_0 , and the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) for all the tangent spaces of B_t . If \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\sum \\Delta x_i \\mathsf{e}_i, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\sum \\Delta X_I \\mathsf{E}_I, then it follows from a straightforward calculation that \\Delta x_i = \\sum F_{iI}\\Delta X_I = \\sum \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_I} \\Delta X_I. The coordinate representation of the deformation gradient follows immediately as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, where F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}. We will at times use the shorthand notation F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\varphi_{i,J}(\\mathsf{X},t) to write this equation. Note that the components of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) can be arranged into a matrix [\\mathsf{F}] whose (i,J)^{\\text{th}} entry is F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) . In terms of this matrix, we see that \\begin{bmatrix} \\Delta x_1\\\\ \\Delta x_2\\\\ \\Delta x_3\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} F_{11} & F_{12} & F_{13}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22} & F_{23}\\\\ F_{31} & F_{32} & F_{33} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\Delta X_1\\\\ \\Delta X_2\\\\ \\Delta X_3\\end{bmatrix}, or, in a much more concise form, [\\Delta \\mathsf{x}] = [\\mathsf{F}][\\Delta\\mathsf{X}] . Let us quickly look into the physical meaning of the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . Suppose that \\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{X}' \\in B_0 are two neighboring points, and let \\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{X}' - \\mathsf{X} . Let the corresponding points in the current placement be \\mathsf{x}, \\mathsf{x}' \\in B_t , and let \\Delta \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{x} - \\mathsf{x}' . In the limit when the line joining \\mathsf{X} and \\mathsf{X}' in B_0 corresponds to an infinitesimal material line segment in \\mathcal{B} , it follows from a simple application of Taylor's theorem that \\begin{split} x'_i &= \\varphi_i(X'_1, X'_2, X'_3, t)\\\\ &= \\varphi_i(X_1 + \\Delta X_1, X_2 + \\Delta X_2, X_3 + \\Delta X_3, t)\\\\ &= \\varphi_i(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) + \\sum \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(X_1,X_2,X_3,t)}{\\partial X_I} \\Delta X_I + o(\\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X}\\rVert^2). \\end{split} Rearranging this, we see that \\Delta x_i \\simeq \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta X_I. The deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) thus tells us how two neighboring points in the initial placement get relatively deformed as a consequence of the deformation. Remark In the derivation above, o(\\cdot) stands for the little 'o' symbol. This is defined as follows: given functions f, g:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} , we say that f = o(g) at x_* \\in \\mathbb{R} if it is true that \\lim_{x \\to x_*} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0. The extension to higher dimensional functions is similarly defined. Let us know revisit the examples we studied in the previous section and compute their deformation gradient Example For the case of a volumetric strain deformation with x_1 = \\lambda_1 X_1 , x_2 = \\lambda_2 X_2 and x_3 = \\lambda_3 X_3 , it follows from a simple computation that F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum \\lambda_i \\delta_{iJ} \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. In matrix form, [\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)] = \\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{bmatrix}. It is a good idea to relate this deformation gradient to the effect the volumetric strain deformation has on a unit cube. Example Let us consider the example of pure shear, with x_1 = X_1 + \\tan \\theta X_2 , x_2 = X_2 and x_3 = X_3 . It follows from a straightforward calculation that [\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, where s = \\tan \\theta denotes the amount of shear. Note that the deformation gradient can be equivalenlty written as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{I} + s \\mathsf{e}_1 \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_2. Here, \\mathsf{I}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t is the identity map that maps the basis (E_I) of T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 to the basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) of T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . In practice, we will often have a few other restrictions on the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . In particular, we will always assume that the deformation gradient is invertible. This implies, in particular that the determinant of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) is non-zero. We will, in fact, show shortly that for physically admissible deformations, \\text{det}(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)) > 0 . We will therefore assume in the sequel the existence of the inverse deformation map \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 .","title":"Deformation gradient"},{"location":"kinematics_deformation/#length-transformation","text":"Let us now see how the length of an infinitesimal line element changes as a consequence of deformation. In what follows, we will identify, as in the preceeding discussions, an infinitesimal line element with an element of the appropriate tangent space. Thus, suppose that the vector \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is mapped to \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t by the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . It follows from a simple calculation that \\begin{split} \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x}\\rVert^2 &= \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= (\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}) \\cdot (\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X})\\\\ &= \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}, \\end{split} where \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t) . Note that \\mathsf{F}^T:T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . We now introduce the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t). Remark Many engineering textbooks write the foregoing equation as \\mathsf{C} = \\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} . We will adopt such a simplified notation when it suits our needs. But it should always be kept in mind what such shorthand notations actually mean. In terms of the bases (\\mathsf{E}_I) and (\\mathsf{e}_i) of the respective tangent spaces, it follows from a simple calculation that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i,\\\\ \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. \\end{split} Remark It is instructive to pause here and reflect on the mathematical difference between the quantities \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Both these are linear maps, and can be converted into tensors on the product spaces T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\otimes T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\otimes T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , respectively. Notice how the definition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) involves two distinct vector spaces, while \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) depends only on one vector space. For this reason, \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called a two-point tensor , while \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) is a tensor in the usual sense of the term as we studied earlier. Returning to our discussion of the change in the length of an infinitesimal line segment as a consequence of deformation, it follows from the developments so far that \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 = \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\left(\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}, where \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Introducing the Green-Lagrange strain tensor , also called the Lagrangian strain tensor , \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right), we see that the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment can be expressed in terms of the Lagrangian strain tensor as \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 = 2\\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}. We thus see that the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment is dictated by the Lagrangian strain tensor. In terms of the basis (\\mathsf{E}_I) of T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , it is straightfoward to verify that \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J, \\qquad E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(C_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) - \\delta_{IJ}\\right). Here, C_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum F_{iI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) are the components of the right Cauchy-Green tensor, and \\delta_{IJ} is the Kronecker delta symbol. The diagonal component fields E_{II}(\\mathsf{X},t) are called axial , or tensile strains, while the off-diagonal component fields E_{IJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) , with I \\neq J are called shear strains. The preceeding discussion allowed us to study the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment in the Lagrangian description. Alternatively, we can describe the same phenomena from the Eulerian viewpoint. Following the same line of thought as above, we see that \\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. Defining the left Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t), where \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) , it follows that \\begin{split} \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathsf{X} &= \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{b}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. \\end{split} The Eulerian strain tensor , also called the Almansi strain tensor , is the map \\mathsf{e}:T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t defined as follows: \\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t) - \\mathsf{I}\\right). Here, \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . Using these definitions, we can now compute the change in length of an infinitesimal line segment in the Eulerian description as follows: \\begin{split} \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2 &= \\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\Delta\\mathsf{x} - \\Delta\\mathsf{x} \\cdot \\mathsf{b}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\\\ &= 2\\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. \\end{split} It is important to note the following identity: \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{x} \\rVert^2 - \\lVert \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\rVert^2\\right) = \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X} = \\Delta\\mathsf{x}\\cdot\\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{x}. Thus, the same physical phenomena can be expressed in two complementary viewpoints. It is however important to develop concrete relations like the one above that express the mutual compatibility of such distinct but equivalent descriptions. Example We would intuitively expect a body undergoing a pure translation or a pure rotation to have zero strain since the relative positions of the body do not change under these kinds of deformations. Let us verify this. Suppose that we are given a deformation \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t of the following form: for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) = \\mathsf{c} + \\mathsf{Q}(\\mathsf{X} - \\mathsf{O}), where \\mathsf{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is a constant vector, and \\mathsf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is some fixed point in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Further, we will assume that the constant map \\mathsf{Q}:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 is orthogonal. With these assumptions, it is clear that this denotes a deformation consisting of a rotation according to the rotation map \\mathsf{Q} about the point \\mathsf{O} followed by a uniform translation \\mathsf{c} . It is left as a straightforward exercise to compute that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{Q}, and, consequently, that \\mathsf{E}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{0} , and \\mathsf{e}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{0} . We thus see that the definition of strain that we have developed is consistent with our intuitive sense of how a strain ought to behave. Once we know how an infinitesimal line element changes in length as a consequence of deformation, the change in length of an arbitrary curve in the initial placement can be computed. Specifically, suppose that \\gamma:I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} \\to B_0 is a curve in B_0 . The length of this curve, L_\\gamma is computed as follows: L_{\\gamma} = \\int_I \\lVert D\\gamma(t)\\rVert dt. Remark It is not difficult to show that the length thus defined is independent of the parametrization of the curve. Indeed, suppose that there exists a smooth, monotonically increasing and surjective function \\tau:I \\to J \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} such that we can formulate an alternative parametrization of the line \\gamma(I) as the curve \\tilde{\\gamma}:J \\to B_0 as follows: \\tilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma \\circ \\tau^{-1} . Let \\tilde{L}_\\gamma denote the length of the curve \\tilde\\gamma ; we expect, based on the fact that \\gamma(I) = \\tilde{\\gamma}(J) that \\tilde{L}_\\gamma = L_\\gamma . Let us verify this: \\begin{split} L_\\gamma &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\gamma(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D(\\tilde\\gamma \\circ \\tau)(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\tilde\\gamma(\\tau(t))\\rVert D\\tau(t) dt\\\\ &= \\int_J \\lVert D\\tilde\\gamma(s) \\rVert ds\\\\ &= \\tilde{L}_\\gamma. \\end{split} In deriving this equation, use has been made of the fact that D\\tau(t) > 0 for every t \\in I . We now wish to find the length l_{\\gamma} of the deformed curve \\varphi_t \\circ \\gamma: I \\to B_t . This follows at once from the following calculation: \\begin{split} l_\\gamma &= \\int_I \\lVert D(\\varphi_t \\circ \\gamma)(t) \\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\lVert D\\varphi(\\gamma(t), t) D\\gamma(t)\\rVert dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\sqrt{\\mathsf{F}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t)} \\,dt\\\\ &= \\int_I \\sqrt{D\\gamma(t) \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\gamma(t),t)D\\gamma(t)} \\,dt. \\end{split} We thus see that a knowledge of the deformation gradient allows us to compute the lengths of any curve in the initial placement.","title":"Length transformation"},{"location":"kinematics_deformation/#volume-transformation","text":"Let us now study how a volume of space occupied by the body at the initial time changes as a consequence of the deformation. Towards that end, we will first find out how an infinitesimal volume transforms as a consequence of deformation, and use this information to compute the change in volume of an arbitray initial volume. Consider three curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3:[-\\epsilon,\\epsilon] \\to B_0 such that \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(0) = \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(0) = \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(0) = \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 .

The starting point is the volume transformation rule that we studied earlier.

Let us now consider an infinitesimal area element \\Delta A \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , defined as follows: \\Delta A = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2(s) \\times \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3(s). Without loss of generality, we will suppose that the curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2,\\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3 are fixed, but \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1 is arbitrary, as long as the tangents of these curves at \\mathsf{X} are not collinear. With this definition, we can write the infinitesimal volume element \\Delta V at \\mathsf{X} defined by the curves \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_2, \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_3 as \\Delta V = \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg\\vert_{s=0} \\hat{\\mathsf{X}}_1(s) \\cdot \\Delta A.

It is worth keeping in mind that \\Delta a \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t and \\Delta A \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , where \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) . To conclude this section, let us look at how the area transformation rule is typically applied in practice. Suppose that we are give a vector field \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t) on B_t . The flux F_{\\mathsf{w}} associated with this vector field is typically computed as F_{\\mathsf{w}} = \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, da, where \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) is the outward normal to B_t at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t . We can compute the flux associated with this vector field equivalently by evaluating the integral over the initial placement B_0 : F_{\\mathsf{w}} = \\int_{\\partial B_0} J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, \\mathsf{w}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) \\cdot \\mathsf{F}^{-T}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{N}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, dA. Notice how the area transformation rule derived earlier for infinitesimal volumes, \" \\mathsf{n}da = J\\mathsf{F}^{-T}\\mathsf{N}dA \", is used in writing the foregoing equation. Defining the Piola transform of the vector field \\mathsf{w} on B_t as the vector field \\mathsf{W} on B_0 , where, for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , \\mathsf{W}(\\mathsf{X},t) = J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}^{-1}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)\\mathsf{w}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t), we see that \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da = \\int_{\\partial B_0} \\mathsf{W}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{N}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dA.

We will now study a very important decomposition of the deformation gradient that will prove to be very useful later on. The basic idea is very simple: a deformation characterized by a pure rotation does not produce any strain; hence, if we are interested in the strain caused by a general deformation, can we extract out its purely rotational components so that we are left with only that part of the deformation that is responsible for an actual shape change? The polar decomposition theorem provides a means to effect this decomposition in a precise manner. Specifically, this theorem states that any deformation graident can be decomposed uniquely as either a pure stretch followed by a pure rotation, or a pure rotation followed by a pure stretch. Specifically, given a deformation \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t , the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , where \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , and \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\in B_t , can be decomposed uniquely as follows: \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t), where \\mathbf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t is an orthogonal map, called the rotation map , that quantifies the purely rotational part of the deformation gradient, and \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 and \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t are symmetric and positive definite tensors, called the right stretch tensor and the left stretch tensor , respectively. The decomposition \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called the right polar decomposition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) , and \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is called the left polar decomposition of \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) . The proof of the polar decomposition theorem is quite simple. To begin with, notice that the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is both symmetric and positive definite. The symmetric of \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) follows from the fact that \\mathsf{C}^T(\\mathsf{X},t) = (\\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t))^T = \\mathsf{F}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t). The positive definiteness of \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) follows from the fact that for any \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = \\lVert \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X}\\rVert^2 \\ge 0. Further, it follows from the same argument that \\Delta \\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta \\mathsf{X} = 0 iff \\Delta X = \\mathsf{0} . Recall from our discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors that since \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) is symmetric and positive definite, we can compute its square root. Define the tensor \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 as follows: \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sqrt{\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)}. It follows from the definition that \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) is both symmetric and positive definite. Define the map \\mathsf{R}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0\\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{U}^{-1}(\\mathsf{X},t). It is easy to check that the map \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is an orthogonal map. Indeed, note that \\mathsf{R}^T\\mathsf{R} = \\mathsf{U}^{-T}\\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F}\\mathsf{U} = \\mathsf{U}^{-1}\\mathsf{U}^2\\mathsf{U} = \\mathsf{I}, where \\mathsf{I}:T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is the identity tensor on T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . Note that we have suppressed the arguments of the various maps to keep the notation simple. A similar argument shows that \\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{R}^T = \\mathsf{I} , where \\mathsf{I} is the identity map on T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t . This shows that \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) is an orthogonal map. We have thus shown that the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) can be written as the action of a symmetric tensor followed by the action of a rotation map. We still need to show that this decomposition is unique. Towards this end, suppose that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) also admits another right polar decomposition of the form \\mathsf{F} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} , where, in the interest of notational simplicity, we have suppressed the arguments of the various maps. It follows from the following argument, \\mathsf{U}^2 = \\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}}^T\\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}}^2, that \\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} . This, along with the equation \\mathsf{R}\\mathsf{U} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}}\\tilde{\\mathsf{U}} shows that \\mathsf{R} = \\tilde{\\mathsf{R}} , thereby establishing the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition. To prove the left decomposition, define the tensor \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t):T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t as follows: V(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sqrt{\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)}, where \\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t) is the left Cauchy-Green tensor. It is easily checked that \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t) is both symmetric and positive definite. It follows from an argument analogous to the previous one that the map \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t defined as S(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}^{-1}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t), is orthogonal. We thus see that the the deformation gradient can be written in the left polar decomposition form as \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{S},t) . We will now show that \\mathsf{S} \\equiv \\mathsf{R} . To see this, note that we can use the orthogonality of \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t) in the following way: \\mathsf{F} = \\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} = (\\mathsf{S}\\mathsf{S}^T)\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} = \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{S}^T\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S}). Notice now that since \\mathsf{S} is orthogonal, and \\mathsf{S}^T\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{S} is symmetric and positive definite, it follows from the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\mathsf{S}(\\mathsf{X},t),\\\\ \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\mathsf{R}^T(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t). \\end{split} We have thus shown that \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) , which this the left polar decomposition. The uniqueness of the left polar decomposition follows from an argument analogous to that of the uniqueness of the right polar decomposition. This completes the proof of the polar decomposition theorem. As a quick consistency check, let us see compute the Lagrangian strain tensor using the polar decomposition theorem: \\mathsf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathsf{F}^T\\mathsf{F} - \\mathsf{I}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathsf{U}^2 - \\mathsf{I}). We have suppressed the arguments for notational convenience. We thus see that the rotation map \\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{X},t) does not contribute to the strain, as expected. A similar caculation shows that this is true for the Eulerian strain tensor too. The strain is entirely captured by the right and left stretch tensors \\mathsf{U}(\\mathsf{X},t) and \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{x},t) , respectively. In this context, it is useful to mention that the eigenvalues of the right and left stretch vectors are called the right principal stretches and left principal stretches , respectively.","title":"Polar decomposition theorem"},{"location":"kinematics_intro/","text":"Basic definitions in Kinematics Observers/frames of reference We will now introduce the crucial notion of an observer , or, equivalently, a frame of reference . For our purposes, a frame of reference is defined as a map that assigns to each event \\mathfrak{e} in spacetime a unique time and space coordinates : \\mathfrak{e} \\mapsto (\\mathsf{x}, t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R}. Here \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 and t \\in \\mathbb{R} are the position and time coordinates of the event \\mathsf{e} according to the observer, or, equivalently, according to the frame of reference. Suppose that we have a second observer who assigns coordinates \\mathsf{x}^*,t^* to the same event \\mathfrak{e} , then the observer transformation map, or, equivalently, the change of reference frame map is computed as (\\mathsf{x},t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} \\mapsto (\\mathsf{x}^*,t^*) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}. We will assume that this is a diffeomorphism on \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} . Recall that a diffeomorphism is an invertible map such that both it and its inverse are continuously differentiable. Remark The space in which the collection of all events \\mathfrak{e} reside is not defined here. What is actually behind this definition is the assumption of a flat spacetime, in line with the Newtonian view of absolute space and absolute time. Rather than getting into the details of this definition, it is sufficient to focus only on the observer transformation/change of reference frame maps, which are diffeomorphisms on \\mathbb{R}^3\\times\\mathbb{R} since that is what we will need in this course. Bodies, configurations and deformations A body \\mathcal{B} is defined as an abstract collection of material points . This is a useful abstraction for the development of continuum mechanics. In practice, what we are interested is how the body \\mathcal{B} moves and deforms in space over a period of time. Towards this end, it is helpful to introduce the notion of a configuration of the body in space. A configuration of the body \\mathcal{B} is a map of the form \\chi:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3, that assigns coordinates \\chi(p) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 to every material point p \\in \\mathcal{B} . The image B = \\chi(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 of the body \\mathcal{B} under \\chi is called the placement of the body \\mathcal{B} according to the configuration \\chi . We will typically assume that B is an open subset of \\mathbb{R}^3 . Further, we will assume that the map \\chi:\\mathcal{B}\\to\\mathbb{R}^3 is injective, or, equivalently, that \\chi:\\mathcal{B} \\to B is bijective. Remark It is important to distinguish between the configuration and placement of a body. For instance, a homogeneous cylinder, and a twisted version of the cylinder both occupy the same region of space, but amount to distinct configurations. Note The assumption that B = \\chi(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 is open in \\mathbb{R}^3 is quite a strong one. For instance, this precludes bodies that occupy a two dimensional surface or one dimensional curves in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Such special bodies are important for certain applications; appropriate extensions of the theories developed here using the tools of differential geometry need to be developed to handle those cases. We focus on the simple case mentioned here in the interest of keeping the mathematical development simple. Suppose now that \\chi_1 and \\chi_2 are two configurations of \\mathcal{B} , the deformation of the body with respect to these configurations is the map \\varphi:B_1 \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to B_2 \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3, where B_1 = \\chi_1(\\mathcal{B}) and B_2 = \\chi_2(\\mathcal{B}) . Notice that the deformation of a body is a map between open subsets of \\mathbb{R}^3 , which are much easier to handle than the abstract configuration maps. For this reason, we will work almost entirely with deformation maps from now on. We will further assume that all the deformation maps we encounter in these notes are diffeomorphisms: this means that they are invertible, and both the deformation and its inverse are smoothly differentiable. Motion of the body in space Let us now look at how a body is described by an observer, or, equivalently, how a body is represented in a frame of reference. The observer assigns, for every instant of time t \\in \\mathbb{R} according to her clock, a configuration \\chi_t:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 such that the body occupies the region B_t = \\chi_t(\\mathcal{B}) . Note that this description is with respect to the specific coordinate system attached to the observer. The sequence of configurations (\\chi_t)_{t \\in I} , where I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} is a time interval of interest, of the body \\mathcal{B} according to the observer is called a motion of \\mathcal{B} in \\mathbb{R}^3 . The one-parameter family of deformation maps \\varphi_t:B_0 \\to B_t , where t \\in I , is defined as follows: for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 = \\chi_0(\\mathcal{B}) , \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) = \\chi_t \\circ \\chi_0^{-1}(\\mathsf{X}). It is useful to introduce the following related variants of the deformation map: \\varphi:B_0 \\times I \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 defined as \\varphi(\\mathsf{X}, t) = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) , and \\varphi_{\\mathsf{X}}:I \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 defined as \\varphi_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t) . A few important terminologies that will be used repeatedly in our development of continuum mechanics are introduced now. In the description of the motion and deformation of a body in space, it is often possible to single out a special configuration \\chi_R:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 called the reference configuration . The corresponding image B_R = \\chi_R(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 is called the reference placement of the body \\mathcal{B} . It is important to note that a reference configuration need not necessarily be a configuration of the body during the motion of the body as observed by an observer. However, it is convenient and typical to identify the reference configuration with the configuration of the body at the initial instant of time, as observered by an observer. Without loss of generality, we can assume the initial instant of time to correspond to t = 0 \\in I . The configuration at t = 0 , \\chi_0:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 , is called the initial configuration . The corresponding image B_0 = \\chi_0(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 is called the initial placement of the body \\mathcal{B} . The configuration of the body at the current instant of time, \\chi_t:\\mathcal{B}\\to\\mathbb{R}^3 is called the current configuration of the body \\mathcal{B} , and the corresponding image B_t = \\chi_t(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 is called its current placement . Note For the sake of simplicity, we will identify the reference configuration with the initial configuration throughout these notes. These two terms will therefore be used interchangeably. It should however be kept in mind that it is perfectly well admissible to have distinct initial and reference configurations. Lagrangian vs Eulerian viewpoints Consider a motion \\chi_t:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 of a body \\mathcal{B} in three dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^3 according to an observer. Let \\chi_0 and \\chi_t be the initial and current configurations, respectively, of the body. Let B_0 and B_t be the initial and current placements, respectively, of the body in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Let us now focus on a real valued physical property of the body. We will now see how the same observer can talk about this physical quantity in many different ways, depending on the point of view she adopts. For concreteness, let us suppose we are interested in assigning a temperature to every point of the body \\mathcal{B} at the current time t . This amounts to a map of the form \\theta_t:B_t\\to\\mathbb{R} that assigns a temperature \\theta_t(\\mathsf{x}) to every point \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t . This is called the Eulerian , or, spatial description of the temperature field. We will also write \\theta(\\mathsf{x},t) for \\theta_t(\\mathsf{x}) . Thus, \\theta(\\mathsf{x},t) denotes the temperature of the material point \\chi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) at the current time t . We can alternatively describe the temperature at the current instant of time in terms of either the initial/reference configuration or the material body as follows. If \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) \\in B_0 is the position occupied by the material point \\chi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) at time t = 0 , then we can define the Lagrangian , or, referential , or initial description of the current temperature using the map \\Theta_t:B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R}, \\qquad \\mathsf{X} \\mapsto \\Theta_t(\\mathsf{X}) = \\theta_t(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})). Note again that this is the temperature at the current time t of the particle that initially occupied the position \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . Finally, we can also talk about the current temperature in terms of the material points using the maps \\hat{\\Theta}_t:\\mathcal{B} \\to \\mathbb{R}, \\qquad p \\mapsto \\hat{\\Theta}_t(p) = \\theta_t(\\chi_t(p)). This is called the material description of the current temperature of the material particle p . Note Some authors use the terms material and Lagrangian/initial interchangeably. If a particular reference configuration that is distinct from the initial configuration is present, then the reference description refers to a description with respect to the reference configuration, and the terms Lagrangian/initial are reserved exclusively for the description with respect to the initial placement. It is always a good idea to be aware of the specific conventions followed in each case. To reiterate a very important point, note that all these descriptions pertain to the description of the temperature field at the current instant of time t . This is summarized in the following equation: \\theta(\\mathsf{x},\\mathbf{t}) = \\Theta(\\mathsf{X},\\mathbf{t}) = \\hat{\\Theta}(p,\\mathbf{t}). Here, \\mathsf{X} = \\chi_0(p) and \\mathsf{x} = \\chi_t(p) . Remark The pointwise assignment of temperature at every instant of time as outlined before is an example of a scalar field. The material, Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of vector and tensor fields are defined in an analogous manner.","title":"Kinematics - basic definitions"},{"location":"kinematics_intro/#basic-definitions-in-kinematics","text":"","title":"Basic definitions in Kinematics"},{"location":"kinematics_intro/#observersframes-of-reference","text":"We will now introduce the crucial notion of an observer , or, equivalently, a frame of reference .

We will now consider the time evolution of a body as it moves and deforms in three dimensional space. We will begin our discussion by focusing on the evolution of a single material point, and subsequently extend it to the time evolution of the deformation gradient. We will, in particular, derive the mass continuity equation as an illustration of working with time derivatives. Finally, we will have a look at the important topic of taking the time derivatives of integrals whose domain and integrands both depend on time. Basic definitions Suppose that (\\chi_t)_{t \\in I} is a motion of a material body \\mathcal{B} in three dimensional space, as observed by an observer. At the initial instant of time, chosen without loss of generality as t = 0 , the body occupies the open subset B_0 \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 of three dimensional space. Let us now focus attention on a fixed point \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and track its evolution as the body moves and deforms in space over the time interval I . The path followed by the body, given by \\{\\varphi_{\\mathsf{X}}:I \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 \\,|\\, \\text{ for any } t \\in I, \\; \\varphi_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) = \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t)\\}, is called the pathline of the point \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . Different particles will have different pathlines, but they never intersect owing to the fact that J(\\mathsf{X},t) > 0 . Remark Pathlines are especially convenient when working with solids, where the correlation between the instantaneous relative positions of the particles remain similar over typical time intervals of interest. In fluids, on the other hand, the chaotic nature of the motion often results in the pathlines being intricately mixed and knotted. In such cases, it is more helpful to work with the streamlines and streaklines . A streamline is a line, defined at every instant of time, such that the tangent vector at any point on the line coincides with the velocity of the particle occupying that position at that specific instant of time. Note that a streamline is globally computed at a given time instant, and can vary over time. A streakline , on the other hand, is the trace of the current position of every particle that occupied a particular fixed point at some previous instant of time. A streakline is what is observed when a dye is injected in a fluid flow a fixed point. Material velocity and acceleration The material velocity of the particle initially at \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 is defined as the map \\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{X}}:I \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 such that, for any t \\in I , \\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) = \\frac{\\partial \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}. We will also use the notation \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t) in place of \\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) , when convenient. If the observer chooses a global basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) for \\mathbb{R}^3 , then the components of the material velocity can be written as \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum V_i(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{e}_i. Note that we use lowercase subscript indices to indicate the components of \\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) . This is because of the fact that though the spatial reference of the point whose velocity we compute is \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 , the velocity vector at time (t) is itself not in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 , but rather in T_{\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})}\\mathbb{R}^3 . Remark Note also that if we focus on a particular instant of time t , \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t) is not necessarily in T_{\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})}B_t , but rather in T_{\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X})}\\mathbb{R}^3 . This is due to the fact that if the body were a surface or a curve in three dimensional space, then T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\subsetneq T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 for every \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t . Since we only deal with cases where the placement of the body at any instant of time is an open subset of \\mathbb{R}^3 , thereby excluding surface-like and line-like bodies from our discussion, this distinction is not important for our purposes. It is nevertheless a good idea to keep this distinction in mind for the sake of conceptual clarity. The material acceleration of the particle initially at \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 is defined as the map \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}:I \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 such that, for any instant of time t \\in I , \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}. As before, we will use the notation \\mathsf{A}(\\mathsf{X},t) in place of \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) when required. Given a global coordinate system, the components of the material acceleration can be computed just as in the case of the material velocity. Remark Techincally speaking, the material acceleration \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) of a particle intially at \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 at time t lives in the linear space T_{\\mathsf{x}}(T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3) , where \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) . However, since the tangent space at a point is always a linear space, we will use the more relaxed notion that \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 . Spatial velocity and acceleration The material version of the velocity and acceleration are quite convenient when studying the behavior of solids. When working with fluids, it is more convenient to focus on the nature of the particles occupying a given point in space at a given instant of time, rather than tracking individual particles (which is often infeasible). Towards this end, we will develop the spatial versions of the velocities and accelerations. Suppose that the body occupies the region B_t \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 at the instant of time t \\in I . Let us focus on a point \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t and denote by \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 the velocity of the particle that occupies the position \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t at the instant of time t . Since this is nothing but the velocity at time t of the particle that was intially at \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) , we have the following identity: \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}), t). The spatial velocity of the particle at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is defined as the map \\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{x}}:I \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 such that \\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{x}}(t) = \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) , for any t \\in I . Remark By defining, for any t \\in I , \\mathsf{v}_t:B_t \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 and \\mathsf{V}_t:B_0 \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 in the usual manner, we see that \\mathsf{v}_t = \\mathsf{V}_t \\circ \\varphi_t^{-1} . The spatial acceleration , \\mathsf{a}_{\\mathsf{x}}:I \\to T\\mathbb {R}^3 , of the particle at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is defined similarly as the acceleration of the particle that was initially at \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) : for any t \\in I , \\mathsf{a}_{\\mathsf{x}}(t) = \\mathsf{A}(\\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}), t). As before, we will at times use the notation \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) in place of \\mathsf{a}_{\\mathsf{x}}(t) . If the observer chooses a global basis (\\mathsf{e}_i) for \\mathbb{R}^3 , the components of the spatial velocity can be expressed as \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\sum v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{e}_i. The coordinate representation of the spatial acceleration is computed likewise. Material time derivatives Recall that the material acceleration is the time derivative of the material velocity. Let us now look at the relation between the spatial velocity and the spatial acceleration. For any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) \\in B_t , we see that \\begin{split} \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\mathsf{A}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{v}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t), t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). \\end{split} Let us now introduce the material time derivative , D\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)/Dt , of the spatial velocity as follows: \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). Remark We have introduce the notation \\text{grad }\\cdot to denote the gradient of a field variable that depends on \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Note that this is different from the gradient operation \\text{GRAD }\\cdot that is defined only for fields defined on B_0 . We thus obtain the following relation between the spatial velocity and the spatial acceleration: \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt}. Unlike the relation between the material velocity and the material acceleration, the spatial acceleration is not the (partial) time derivative of the spatial velocity; in addition to the partial time derivative of the spatial velocity with respect to time, it also has the the convective term \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) . The physical intuition behind this expression for the spatial acceleration is that the velocity at a given point in space changes as a consequence of both a local change in velocity, and because of material convected to the considered point due to the motion of the body. Let us quickly work out the expression for the material time derivative of the velocity according to a global basis \\mathsf{e}_i of \\mathbb{R}^3 chosen by an observer. It follows from a simple calculation that a_i(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_j}v_j(\\mathsf{x},t). Note It is important to note that \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} \\neq \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} in general. Many authors write the convective term of the material time derivative of the spatial velocity as \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathsf{v} in place of what we write as \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} . To avoid ambiguity, we will always use the notation \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} . For completeness, let us also note that the material time derivative of the material velocity is defined simply as the partial time derivative: \\frac{D\\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}. Notice how the same term material time derivative is used to describe the time derivative as we follow a particle for both material and spatial velocity fields. Though this terminology can be confusing, it does not cause any problems in practice since the meaning is always evident from the context. Remark Many authors use the notation \\dot{\\mathsf{v}}(\\mathsf{x},t) for the material time derivative. We will also adopt this convention at places. In terms of this notation, the relation between the spatial velocity and spatial acceleration can be written succinctly as \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\dot{\\mathsf{v}}(\\mathsf{x},t) . Note that in the case of the material velocity, the dot notation is identical to the partial derivative with respect to time. The foregoing definition of the material time derivative can be extended to both scalar and tensor fields. For instance, if \\tau(\\mathsf{x},t) \\in \\otimes^k T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 denotes a tensor field of order k , then its material time derivative is computed as \\frac{D\\tau(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\tau(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\tau(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). The material time derivative of a material tensor field is simply its partial time derivative. Time derivaties related to deformation Let us now turn our attention to the time evolution of quantities associated with the deformation of a body in three dimensional space. To keep the discussion simple, only the time derivatives of a few important quantities associated with the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) are considered in detail. For the purpose of this discussion, we will use two sets of bases: (\\mathsf{E}_I) for quantities associated with the initial placement B_0 , and (\\mathsf{e}_i) for the ambient three dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^3 . Note that these are chosen by a given observer. Note also that these are often identical to each other, and the distinction is retained here purely for the purpose of conceptual clarity. Let us start with the time evolution of the deformation gradient itself. The material time derivative of the deformation gradient, which is identical to its partial derivative with respect to time, is given in coordinate form as \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum \\frac{\\partial{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. It is worth reiterating that \\dot{\\mathsf{F}} stands for the material time derivative of \\mathsf{F} . The material time derivative of the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is computed similarly: \\begin{split} \\dot{\\mathsf{C}}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\sum F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J\\right)\\\\ &= \\sum \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) + F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{\\partial F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\right) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. \\end{split} Noting that \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t) = \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i , we see that \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t) = \\sum \\frac{\\partial F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i. We therefore arrive at the following expression for the material time derivative of the right Cauchy-Green tensor: \\dot{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) + \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t). The Lagrangian rate of deformation tensor \\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is defined as \\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{D\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{Dt}. To understand the physical relevance of this tensor, consider two vectors \\Delta \\mathsf{X}, \\Delta \\mathsf{Y} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . The angle between these two vectors is computed using \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\Delta\\mathsf{Y} . As the body deforms in space accoring to a prescribed motion, the inner product of the corresponding deformed vectors also evolves with time. Let us compute the rate at which this change: \\begin{split} \\frac{D(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y})}{Dt} &= \\frac{D(\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y})}{Dt}\\\\ &= 2\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y}. \\end{split} We thus see that the Lagrangian rate of deformation tensor gives us information about how the angle between two vectors in a given tangent space evolve as a consequence of deformation. As a final and non-trivial example of computing the material time derivatives related to the deformation, let us compute the material time derivative of the determinant of the deformation gradient, but this time around, in the Eulerian setting. Recall that the Jacobian of the deformation is defined as J(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\text{det }\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and t \\in I . The spatial version of the Jacobian, which we will denote as J(\\mathsf{x},t) , where \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , is defined as J(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\text{det }\\mathsf{J}(\\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}), t). Note that we are using the same symbol \\mathsf{J} for both the material and spatial versions of the Jacobian; this is largely done because of conventional practice in the continuum mechanics literature. We will now show that the material time derivative of the Jacobian, when expressed in the Eulerian form, is given by \\frac{DJ(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\mathsf{J}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). Here, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) stands for the divergence, with respect to the spatial variable \\mathsf{x} , of the spatial velocity \\mathsf{v}_t(\\mathsf{x}) . This equation will play a key role in deriving various results in the forthcoming sections; it is worthwhile working out the proof of this statement. To keep the algebra simple, let us focus on the special case of motion in a two dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^2 . The material time derivative of the Jacobian is most easily computed in material form, and using Cartesian coordinates: if \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) , \\begin{split} \\frac{DJ(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} &= \\frac{\\partial J(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\text{det} \\begin{bmatrix} F_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ F_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix}\\right)\\\\ &= \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{F}_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & \\dot{F}_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ F_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix} + \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} F_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ \\dot{F}_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & \\dot{F}_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix}. \\end{split} To compute \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) note that \\begin{split} \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_J}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial V_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}. \\end{split} Using the fact that \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{v}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) , we see that \\begin{split} \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)}{\\partial x_j}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_j(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_j} F_{jJ}(\\mathsf{X},t). \\end{split} Subsituting this expression for \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) in the expression for \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) derived earlier, we get, after a tedious but straightforward expansion, \\begin{split} \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} v_{1,1}F_{11} + v_{1,2}F_{21} & v_{1,1}F_{12} + v_{1,2}F_{22}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &+ \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ v_{2,1}F_{11} + v_{1,2}F_{21} & v_{2,1}F_{12} + v_{2,2}F_{22}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &= v_{1,1}\\,\\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix}F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22}\\end{bmatrix} + v_{2,2}\\,\\text{det} \\begin{bmatrix}F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22}\\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &= \\left(\\frac{\\partial v_1(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_1} + \\frac{\\partial v_2(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_2}\\right) J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\\\ &= J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). \\end{split} In the foregoing derivation, we have used the shortand notation v_{i,j} to denote \\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)/\\partial x_j , and omitted the arguments in some of the intermediate expressions to keep the notation simple. A similar but more tedious argument can be used to show that the same result holds in three dimensions too. This completes the proof of the important result: \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) . Mass continuity equation As an immediate and useful application of the expression for the material time derivative for the determinant of the deformation gradient just derived, let us derive the mass continuity equation . This will also provide a gentle segue to the balance principles that we will study later on, after completing our study of kinematics. Suppose that the mass density of the body at the inital instant of time t = 0 is given by the scalar field \\rho_0:B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R} . This means that if we consider an infinitesimal volume \\Delta V about a point \\mathsf{X}\\in B_0 , the mass contained within that volume is given by \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\Delta V . Let the mass density at time time over the region B_t = \\varphi_t(B_0) be given by the scalar field \\rho_t:B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} . At any \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , we will often write \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) for \\rho_t(\\mathsf{x}) . Suppose that \\Delta v is the deformed volume at \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) corresponding to the intial infinitesimal volume \\Delta V at \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . The mass inside the volume \\Delta v is exactly identical to the mass inside \\Delta V initially since both \\Delta V and \\Delta v contain exactly the same particles. We therefore have the identity \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\Delta V = \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) \\Delta v. Using the fact that the \\Delta v = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta V , we can write the equation above as \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X}) = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t). This equation is known as the mass conservation equation on account of the fact that it relates the initial and current mass densities. The mass conservation equation can be cast into a differential equation by taking the material time derivative of the equation \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X}) = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) . Since \\dot{\\rho}_0(\\mathsf{X}) = 0 , we see that \\begin{split} 0 &= \\frac{D(J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t))}{Dt}\\\\ &= \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) + J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\dot{\\rho}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\\\ &= J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) \\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) + J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\right)\\\\ &= J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{div}(\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)) \\right). \\end{split} In deriving this equation, we used the identity: \\text{div}(\\rho \\mathsf{v}) = \\rho \\, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v} + \\text{grad }\\rho \\cdot \\mathsf{v} . Since the determinant of the deformation gradient is always strictly positive, we arrive at the following equation: \\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{div}(\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)) = 0. This equation is known as the mass continuity equation , and is the differential statement of the mass conservation equation \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X}) = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) . Note that we can also write the mass continuity equation in terms of the material time derivative of the density field as \\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = 0. Both these forms are useful in applications. We will also present an alternative derivation of the mass continuity equation later on. Reynolds' transport theorem To conclude our discussion of time derivatives of various quantities related to the motion and deformation of a body in three dimensional space, let us consider material time derivatives of the form \\frac{D}{Dt} \\int_{B_t} f(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv. Here, f:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times I \\to \\mathbb{R} is a scalar field. Note that both the integrand f(\\mathsf{x},t) and the domain of integration B_t = \\varphi_t(B_0) are functions of time. The reason for studying such integrals will become evident soon. In short, we will see that all the balance principles of continuum mechanics that we will study later on will be expressed primarily in an integral form; the rationale behind this will be explained when we study balance principles in continuum mechanics. The standard procedure to evaluate the material time derivatives of time dependent integrals of the form presented above is to first pull back the integral to the reference placement using the change of variables formula for integration, and take the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian form of the integral. Let us work this out in detail: \\begin{split} \\frac{D}{Dt} \\int_{B_t} f(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv &= \\frac{D}{Dt}\\int_{B_0} f(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(f(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\right)\\, dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} \\left(\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\left(\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right) \\, dv. \\end{split} In deriving the foregoing relation, we have used some of the identities derived in the context of the mass continuity equation. Remark As a simple illustration, consider an initial volume \\Omega_0 \\subseteq B_0 . Let us study the evolution of the mass contained within this volume, which is \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\,dV. At a later time t , the mass contained the in the deformed volume \\Omega_t = \\varphi_t(\\Omega_0) is given by \\int_{\\Omega_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. Since we expect this mass to be exactly identical to the mass contained in the initial volume \\Omega_0 , we expect the material time derivative of the mass contained in \\Omega_t to be zero. Let us verify this: \\frac{D}{Dt}\\int_{\\Omega_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{\\Omega_t} \\left(\\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right) \\, dv = 0. In the equation above, the last identity follows from the mass continuity equation derived earlier. We thus see that mass continuity equation expresses the simple idea that the mass contained an arbitrary volume of the body does not change if we follow the volume during the motion and deformation of the body. Finally, n the special case when the integrand is of the form \\rho f , where \\rho is the mass density and f is a scalar field, we can use the mass continuity equation to simplify the material time derivative of the integral as follows: \\frac{D}{Dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt}\\,dv. It is left as a simple exercise to verify this. This important result is known as the Reynolds' transport theorem , and will play a key role in our study of the balance principles of continuum mechanics.","title":"Analysis of motion"},{"location":"kinematics_motion/#analysis-of-motion","text":"Our discussion of kinematics thus far has focused on the deformation of the initial placement of a body to its current placement.

In such cases, it is more helpful to work with the streamlines and streaklines .

Note that a streamline is globally computed at a given time instant, and can vary over time.

This is due to the fact that if the body were a surface or a curve in three dimensional space, then T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t \\subsetneq T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 for every \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t . Since we only deal with cases where the placement of the body at any instant of time is an open subset of \\mathbb{R}^3 , thereby excluding surface-like and line-like bodies from our discussion, this distinction is not important for our purposes. It is nevertheless a good idea to keep this distinction in mind for the sake of conceptual clarity. The material acceleration of the particle initially at \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 is defined as the map \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}:I \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 such that, for any instant of time t \\in I , \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}. As before, we will use the notation \\mathsf{A}(\\mathsf{X},t) in place of \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) when required. Given a global coordinate system, the components of the material acceleration can be computed just as in the case of the material velocity. Remark Techincally speaking, the material acceleration \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) of a particle intially at \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 at time t lives in the linear space T_{\\mathsf{x}}(T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3) , where \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) . However, since the tangent space at a point is always a linear space, we will use the more relaxed notion that \\mathsf{A}_{\\mathsf{X}}(t) \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 .","title":"Material velocity and acceleration"},{"location":"kinematics_motion/#spatial-velocity-and-acceleration","text":"The material version of the velocity and acceleration are quite convenient when studying the behavior of solids. When working with fluids, it is more convenient to focus on the nature of the particles occupying a given point in space at a given instant of time, rather than tracking individual particles (which is often infeasible). Towards this end, we will develop the spatial versions of the velocities and accelerations. Suppose that the body occupies the region B_t \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 at the instant of time t \\in I . Let us focus on a point \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t and denote by \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 the velocity of the particle that occupies the position \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t at the instant of time t . Since this is nothing but the velocity at time t of the particle that was intially at \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) , we have the following identity: \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\mathsf{V}(\\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}), t). The spatial velocity of the particle at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is defined as the map \\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{x}}:I \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 such that \\mathsf{v}_{\\mathsf{x}}(t) = \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) , for any t \\in I .

The spatial acceleration , \\mathsf{a}_{\\mathsf{x}}:I \\to T\\mathbb {R}^3 , of the particle at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 is defined similarly as the acceleration of the particle that was initially at \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) : for any t \\in I , \\mathsf{a}_{\\mathsf{x}}(t) = \\mathsf{A}(\\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}), t).

Remark We have introduce the notation \\text{grad }\\cdot to denote the gradient of a field variable that depends on \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 . Note that this is different from the gradient operation \\text{GRAD }\\cdot that is defined only for fields defined on B_0 . We thus obtain the following relation between the spatial velocity and the spatial acceleration: \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{D\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt}. Unlike the relation between the material velocity and the material acceleration, the spatial acceleration is not the (partial) time derivative of the spatial velocity; in addition to the partial time derivative of the spatial velocity with respect to time, it also has the the convective term \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) . The physical intuition behind this expression for the spatial acceleration is that the velocity at a given point in space changes as a consequence of both a local change in velocity, and because of material convected to the considered point due to the motion of the body. Let us quickly work out the expression for the material time derivative of the velocity according to a global basis \\mathsf{e}_i of \\mathbb{R}^3 chosen by an observer. It follows from a simple calculation that a_i(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_j}v_j(\\mathsf{x},t). Note It is important to note that \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} \\neq \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} in general. Many authors write the convective term of the material time derivative of the spatial velocity as \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathsf{v} in place of what we write as \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} . To avoid ambiguity, we will always use the notation \\text{grad }\\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} . For completeness, let us also note that the material time derivative of the material velocity is defined simply as the partial time derivative: \\frac{D\\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}. Notice how the same term material time derivative is used to describe the time derivative as we follow a particle for both material and spatial velocity fields. Though this terminology can be confusing, it does not cause any problems in practice since the meaning is always evident from the context. Remark Many authors use the notation \\dot{\\mathsf{v}}(\\mathsf{x},t) for the material time derivative. We will also adopt this convention at places. In terms of this notation, the relation between the spatial velocity and spatial acceleration can be written succinctly as \\mathsf{a}(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\dot{\\mathsf{v}}(\\mathsf{x},t) . Note that in the case of the material velocity, the dot notation is identical to the partial derivative with respect to time. The foregoing definition of the material time derivative can be extended to both scalar and tensor fields. For instance, if \\tau(\\mathsf{x},t) \\in \\otimes^k T_{\\mathsf{x}}\\mathbb{R}^3 denotes a tensor field of order k , then its material time derivative is computed as \\frac{D\\tau(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\tau(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\tau(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). The material time derivative of a material tensor field is simply its partial time derivative.","title":"Material time derivatives"},{"location":"kinematics_motion/#time-derivaties-related-to-deformation","text":"Let us now turn our attention to the time evolution of quantities associated with the deformation of a body in three dimensional space. To keep the discussion simple, only the time derivatives of a few important quantities associated with the deformation gradient \\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) are considered in detail. For the purpose of this discussion, we will use two sets of bases: (\\mathsf{E}_I) for quantities associated with the initial placement B_0 , and (\\mathsf{e}_i) for the ambient three dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^3 . Note that these are chosen by a given observer. Note also that these are often identical to each other, and the distinction is retained here purely for the purpose of conceptual clarity. Let us start with the time evolution of the deformation gradient itself. The material time derivative of the deformation gradient, which is identical to its partial derivative with respect to time, is given in coordinate form as \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\sum \\frac{\\partial{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} \\mathsf{e}_i \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. It is worth reiterating that \\dot{\\mathsf{F}} stands for the material time derivative of \\mathsf{F} . The material time derivative of the right Cauchy-Green tensor \\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is computed similarly: \\begin{split} \\dot{\\mathsf{C}}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\sum F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J\\right)\\\\ &= \\sum \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) + F_{kI}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\frac{\\partial F_{kJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\right) \\mathsf{E}_I \\otimes \\mathsf{E}_J. \\end{split} Noting that \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t) = \\sum F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i , we see that \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t) = \\sum \\frac{\\partial F_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t} \\mathsf{E}_J \\otimes \\mathsf{e}_i. We therefore arrive at the following expression for the material time derivative of the right Cauchy-Green tensor: \\dot{C}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\dot{\\mathsf{F}}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X},t)\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) + \\mathsf{F}^T(\\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}),t)\\dot{\\mathsf{F}}(\\mathsf{X},t). The Lagrangian rate of deformation tensor \\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t):T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 \\to T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 is defined as \\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{D\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)}{Dt}. To understand the physical relevance of this tensor, consider two vectors \\Delta \\mathsf{X}, \\Delta \\mathsf{Y} \\in T_{\\mathsf{X}}B_0 . The angle between these two vectors is computed using \\Delta\\mathsf{X} \\cdot \\Delta\\mathsf{Y} . As the body deforms in space accoring to a prescribed motion, the inner product of the corresponding deformed vectors also evolves with time. Let us compute the rate at which this change: \\begin{split} \\frac{D(\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y})}{Dt} &= \\frac{D(\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y})}{Dt}\\\\ &= 2\\Delta\\mathsf{X}\\cdot\\mathsf{D}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\Delta\\mathsf{Y}. \\end{split} We thus see that the Lagrangian rate of deformation tensor gives us information about how the angle between two vectors in a given tangent space evolve as a consequence of deformation. As a final and non-trivial example of computing the material time derivatives related to the deformation, let us compute the material time derivative of the determinant of the deformation gradient, but this time around, in the Eulerian setting. Recall that the Jacobian of the deformation is defined as J(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\text{det }\\mathsf{F}(\\mathsf{X},t) for any \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 and t \\in I . The spatial version of the Jacobian, which we will denote as J(\\mathsf{x},t) , where \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , is defined as J(\\mathsf{x},t) = \\text{det }\\mathsf{J}(\\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}), t). Note that we are using the same symbol \\mathsf{J} for both the material and spatial versions of the Jacobian; this is largely done because of conventional practice in the continuum mechanics literature. We will now show that the material time derivative of the Jacobian, when expressed in the Eulerian form, is given by \\frac{DJ(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} = \\mathsf{J}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). Here, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) stands for the divergence, with respect to the spatial variable \\mathsf{x} , of the spatial velocity \\mathsf{v}_t(\\mathsf{x}) . This equation will play a key role in deriving various results in the forthcoming sections; it is worthwhile working out the proof of this statement. To keep the algebra simple, let us focus on the special case of motion in a two dimensional space \\mathbb{R}^2 . The material time derivative of the Jacobian is most easily computed in material form, and using Cartesian coordinates: if \\mathsf{X} = \\varphi_t^{-1}(\\mathsf{x}) , \\begin{split} \\frac{DJ(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} &= \\frac{\\partial J(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\text{det} \\begin{bmatrix} F_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ F_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix}\\right)\\\\ &= \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{F}_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & \\dot{F}_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ F_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix} + \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} F_{11}(\\mathsf{X},t) & F_{12}(\\mathsf{X},t)\\\\ \\dot{F}_{21}(\\mathsf{X},t) & \\dot{F}_{22}(\\mathsf{X},t) \\end{bmatrix}. \\end{split} To compute \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) note that \\begin{split} \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_J}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial t}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial V_i(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}. \\end{split} Using the fact that \\mathsf{V}(\\mathsf{X},t) = \\mathsf{v}(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) , we see that \\begin{split} \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) &= \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t)}{\\partial x_j}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi_j(\\mathsf{X},t)}{\\partial X_J}\\\\ &= \\sum \\frac{\\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_j} F_{jJ}(\\mathsf{X},t). \\end{split} Subsituting this expression for \\dot{F}_{iJ}(\\mathsf{X},t) in the expression for \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) derived earlier, we get, after a tedious but straightforward expansion, \\begin{split} \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) &= \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} v_{1,1}F_{11} + v_{1,2}F_{21} & v_{1,1}F_{12} + v_{1,2}F_{22}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &+ \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ v_{2,1}F_{11} + v_{1,2}F_{21} & v_{2,1}F_{12} + v_{2,2}F_{22}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &= v_{1,1}\\,\\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix}F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22}\\end{bmatrix} + v_{2,2}\\,\\text{det} \\begin{bmatrix}F_{11} & F_{12}\\\\ F_{21} & F_{22}\\end{bmatrix}\\\\ &= \\left(\\frac{\\partial v_1(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_1} + \\frac{\\partial v_2(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial x_2}\\right) J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\\\ &= J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t). \\end{split} In the foregoing derivation, we have used the shortand notation v_{i,j} to denote \\partial v_i(\\mathsf{x},t)/\\partial x_j , and omitted the arguments in some of the intermediate expressions to keep the notation simple. A similar but more tedious argument can be used to show that the same result holds in three dimensions too.

This will also provide a gentle segue to the balance principles that we will study later on, after completing our study of kinematics. Suppose that the mass density of the body at the inital instant of time t = 0 is given by the scalar field \\rho_0:B_0 \\to \\mathbb{R} . This means that if we consider an infinitesimal volume \\Delta V about a point \\mathsf{X}\\in B_0 , the mass contained within that volume is given by \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\Delta V . Let the mass density at time time over the region B_t = \\varphi_t(B_0) be given by the scalar field \\rho_t:B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} . At any \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , we will often write \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) for \\rho_t(\\mathsf{x}) . Suppose that \\Delta v is the deformed volume at \\mathsf{x} = \\varphi_t(\\mathsf{X}) corresponding to the intial infinitesimal volume \\Delta V at \\mathsf{X} \\in B_0 . The mass inside the volume \\Delta v is exactly identical to the mass inside \\Delta V initially since both \\Delta V and \\Delta v contain exactly the same particles.

Using the fact that the \\Delta v = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta V , we can write the equation above as \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X}) = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t). This equation is known as the mass conservation equation on account of the fact that it relates the initial and current mass densities. The mass conservation equation can be cast into a differential equation by taking the material time derivative of the equation \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X}) = J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) . Since \\dot{\\rho}_0(\\mathsf{X}) = 0 , we see that \\begin{split} 0 &= \\frac{D(J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t))}{Dt}\\\\ &= \\dot{J}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) + J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\dot{\\rho}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\\\ &= J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) \\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) + J(\\mathsf{x},t) \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{grad }\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t) \\cdot \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) \\right)\\\\ &= J(\\mathsf{x},t)\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{\\partial t} + \\text{div}(\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)) \\right). \\end{split} In deriving this equation, we used the identity: \\text{div}(\\rho \\mathsf{v}) = \\rho \\, \\text{div }\\mathsf{v} + \\text{grad }\\rho \\cdot \\mathsf{v} .

Here, f:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times I \\to \\mathbb{R} is a scalar field. Note that both the integrand f(\\mathsf{x},t) and the domain of integration B_t = \\varphi_t(B_0) are functions of time. The reason for studying such integrals will become evident soon. In short, we will see that all the balance principles of continuum mechanics that we will study later on will be expressed primarily in an integral form; the rationale behind this will be explained when we study balance principles in continuum mechanics. The standard procedure to evaluate the material time derivatives of time dependent integrals of the form presented above is to first pull back the integral to the reference placement using the change of variables formula for integration, and take the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian form of the integral. Let us work this out in detail: \\begin{split} \\frac{D}{Dt} \\int_{B_t} f(\\mathsf{x},t) \\, dv &= \\frac{D}{Dt}\\int_{B_0} f(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) J(\\mathsf{X},t) \\, dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(f(\\varphi(\\mathsf{X},t),t) J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\right)\\, dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_0} \\left(\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)J(\\mathsf{X},t)\\,dV\\\\ &= \\int_{B_t} \\left(\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right) \\, dv. \\end{split} In deriving the foregoing relation, we have used some of the identities derived in the context of the mass continuity equation. Remark As a simple illustration, consider an initial volume \\Omega_0 \\subseteq B_0 . Let us study the evolution of the mass contained within this volume, which is \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\rho_0(\\mathsf{X})\\,dV. At a later time t , the mass contained the in the deformed volume \\Omega_t = \\varphi_t(\\Omega_0) is given by \\int_{\\Omega_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. Since we expect this mass to be exactly identical to the mass contained in the initial volume \\Omega_0 , we expect the material time derivative of the mass contained in \\Omega_t to be zero. Let us verify this: \\frac{D}{Dt}\\int_{\\Omega_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{\\Omega_t} \\left(\\frac{D\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt} + \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,\\text{div }\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right) \\, dv = 0. In the equation above, the last identity follows from the mass continuity equation derived earlier. We thus see that mass continuity equation expresses the simple idea that the mass contained an arbitrary volume of the body does not change if we follow the volume during the motion and deformation of the body. Finally, n the special case when the integrand is of the form \\rho f , where \\rho is the mass density and f is a scalar field, we can use the mass continuity equation to simplify the material time derivative of the integral as follows: \\frac{D}{Dt}\\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)f(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv = \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\frac{Df(\\mathsf{x},t)}{Dt}\\,dv.

In the first half of this chapter, we will review the elements of thermodynamics as it applies to a general system interacting with an environment. Subsetequently, we will generalize and extend these notions to make them applicable for continuum mechanics. Review of Thermodynamics The subject matter that we will review here is variously called equilibrium thermodynamics , or, more appropriately, thermostatics . The primary concern of thermodynamics is a global description of the behavior of a system interacting with an environment , possibly exchanging energy and/or mass in the process. We will formalize these notions below. One of the hallmarks of the thermodynamic description of a phenomena is its generality - it is applicable for any macroscopic phenomena. Trivia There is no better way to summarize the status of thermodynamics among other theories of physics than the introduction provided by Gerard Maugin in his book The thermomechanics of nonlinear irreversible behaviors: An introduction : \" Perhaps, after all, the wise man's attitude towards thermodynamics should be to have nothing to do with it. To deal with thermodynamics is to look for trouble. This is not the citation of a famous scientist, but the result of a deep cogitation following mere observations. Why do we need to get involved in a field of knowledge which, within the last hundred years, has exhibited the largest number of schizophrenics and megalomaniacs, imbalanced scientists, paranoiacs, egocentrists, and probably insomniacs and sleepwalkers? Is there any other field of scientific activity such as this one where, apparently, each of the bricklayers has unhesitatingly revindicated an originality that [...] we may see but with confusion. For some thermodynamicists and for their enemies as well, thermodynamics is the science of everything, so that for the second category of individuals, it is, by mere logic, the science of nothing, and thus not a science at all; and the \"everything\" is naturally seen as a sign of megalomania from which some have not escaped. [...] \" The excerpts given above should give you an idea of the effect thermodynamics can have on you if you dig deeper. In any case, keep in mind that every thermodynamicist worth their salt has their own point of view, often a very strong one! Basic definitions A thermodynamic system , or just a system , is the part of the universe that we are interested in. The rest of the universe is called the environment . The implicit understanding in this description is that the system is in contact with its environment. We also say that the system interacts with its environment. The interaction of the system with the environment is understood to be through one of two mechanisms: work and heat . Both these are special kinds of energies; the difference is that work refers a controllable form of energy, while heat refers to the part of the energy that is uncontrollable and often associated with dissipative internal mechanisms in the system. Remark An important assumption that we will make throughout this course is that all interactions are short-ranged This means that there are no long range forces in the system, or in the interactions between the system and its environment. A defining feature of the thermodynamic approach is the study of a complex system as a black box, without any detailed consideration of the microscopic constitution of the system. The system is thus described by means of measurable physical quantities called thermodynamic variables , also known as state variables . The thermodynamic variables together determine the thermodynamic state , also referred to as just the state , of the system. It is important to note, however, that there is no universal recipe to determine the thermodynamic variables to describe a system; it is contextual and depends entirely on the system being investigated. It is conventional to classify thermodynamic variables as being extensive , or intensive . An extensive state variable is one whose value is doubled if we double the system size, whereas an intensive variable is one which is independent of system size. We will see examples of these shortly. An important extensive state variable that is common to all thermodynamic systems is the internal energy , E . Loosely, put, this the internal energy of a system is a measure of the total energy that the system posseses. In addition to the internal energy, we will typically characterize the sytem by means of a finite number of extensive state variables, which we will denote as Y_1, Y_2, \\ldots, Y_n . Example As a simple example, consider a gas enclosed in cylinder, one face of which is controlled by a piston. The state variables in this case are the internal energy, volume of the cylinder, and the number of particles in the gas (in appropriate unis). Note The fact that the internal energy is an extensive variable is dependent on the assumption that all the interactions are short-ranged. In the presence of long-range interactions, the extensivity of the internal energy is not a valid assumption in general. The system is said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment if the state variables of the system do not change with time. Implicit in this description of equilibrium is the choice of a time scale with respect to which the variation of the state variables is negligible. Note The notion of thermodynamic equilibrium is distinct from the notion of mechanical equilibrium. The latter is characterized by a net balance of forces acting on the system. This is not true in thermodynamic equilibrium. In addition to the internal energy, another extensive variable that is common to all thermodynamic systems is the entropy of the system, S . The best means to gain some intuition about entropy is from statistical mechanics . For the present purposes, it is sufficient to think of entropy loosely as a measure of disorder in the system, or, equivalently, a measure of how much the energy supplied to a system degrades to a form that is unusable. Remark If you are really interested in the statistical mechanical underpinnings of the notion of entropy, you are welcome to register for the course AE 731: Multiscale Modeling of Materials . If you're tired of my lecturing and would rather prefer learning it on your own, you can consult the many excellent textbooks on statistical mechanics out there; for instance, a simple and elegant discussino of the notion of entropy from the statistical mechanical perspective can be found here . A fundamental postulate of equilibrium thermodynamics is that the entropy is a well defined function of the other extensive variables that characterize the system: S = \\hat{S}(E,Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n). This equation is called the fundamental equation of the thermodynamic system. Further, we will assume that \\hat{S} is a monotonically increasing function of E . This assumption permits us to invert the fundamental relation to obtain the internal energy E as a function of the entropy S and the other extensive variables of the system: E = \\hat{E}(S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n). Both these forms of the fundamental equation are useful in practice. The temperature of the system, T , is defined either in terms of the function \\hat{E} as T = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{E}(S,Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)}{\\partial S}, or in terms of the function \\hat{S} as \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{S}(E, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)}{\\partial E}. Both these definitions are equivalent. The temperature thus defined is also known as the absolute temperature of the system. Note that T is an intensive variable since both E and S are extensive variables. We will now briefly consider the partial derivatives of \\hat{E} with respect to the other thermodynamic variables. We define the thermodynamic driving force X_i , where 1 \\le i \\le n , as X_i = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{E}(S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)}{\\partial Y_i}. The thermodynamic driving force X_i is said to be conjugate to the thermodynamic variable Y_i . It is helpful to think of X_i as the generalized force corresponding to the generalized displacement Y_i . Suppose now that the system is in a particular state, say A , and as a consequence of its interactions with the environment, it evolves to a different state B . The path followed by the system in the space of admissible thermodynamic variables in going from the state A to the state B is called a thermodynamic process . We will particularly be interested in reversible thermodynamic processes - these have the property that the process can be localy reversed in time, and further that the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium at every intermediate state of the process. It is convenient to think of a reversible thermodynamic process as a quasi-static process - this means that the process is carried out slow enough that the system is in equilibrium at every step of the process. A thermodynamic process that is not reversible is said to be irreversible . First law of thermodynamics The first law of thermodynamics is essentially a statement of conservation of energy. Recall that the energy of a system is not necessarily constant since it interacts with the environment. But the sum of the energies of the system and the environment is a constant. We can alternatively state this is as follows: the change in energy of the system during a thermodynamic process that takes it from state A to state B is exactly equal to the energy supplied to, or, extracted from the system as a consequence of its interaction with the environment during this thermodynamic process. Since the only means by which a system can interact with its environment is through work and/or heat, we see that \\Delta E_{AB} = W_{AB} + Q_{AB}. Here, \\Delta E_{AB} is the change in the internal energy of the system as it moves from state A to state B . W_{AB} is the work done on the system by the environment durign the thermodynamic process AB , and Q_{AB} is the heat supplied to the system by the environment during the same thermodynamic process. It is important to note that \\Delta E_{AB} = E_B - E_A . In other words, the change in internal energy is simply a difference of the initial and final internal energies, and does not depend on the particular details of the path connecting the states A and B . The terms W_{AB} and Q_{AB} , on the other hand, are typically path-dependent and need a detailed specification of the path from state A to state B . The work done in moving from state A to state B can be written as W_{AB} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_{A}^{B} X_i(S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n) \\, dY_i. Here, (S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n) is an intermediate state in the thermodynamic path connecting the states A and B . Remark Notice the similarity of the expression with the expression of the work done in elementary mechanics as the line integral, along a specified path, of the inner product of the instantaneous force and the corresponding infinitesimal displacement. Second law of thermodynamics The second law of thermodynamics is more subtle law which states that the change in entropy \\Delta S_{AB} of the system as it goes from state A to state B is always non-negative, irrespective of whether the thermodynamic path AB is reversible or irreversible: \\Delta S_{AB} \\ge 0. Here, \\Delta S_{AB} = S_B - S_A denotes the total change in entropy of the system. If Q_{AB} denotes the total heat supplied to the system during the thermodynamic process AB , and if T denotes the temperature of the environment during the process AB , we can write the change in entropy \\Delta S_{AB} as follows: \\Delta S_{AB} = \\frac{Q_{AB}}{T} + \\Delta S_i, \\qquad \\Delta S_i \\ge 0. The change in entropy entirely due to the influx of heat is given by Q_{AB}/T , while \\Delta S_i denotes internal irreversible production of entropy in the system as a consequence of the thermodynamic process. The fact that \\Delta S_i \\ge 0 can be equivalently written as \\Delta S_{AB} \\ge \\frac{Q_{AB}}{T}. Remark A generalized version of this inequality, known as the Clausius-Duhem inequality , will serve as the primary statement of the second law of thermodynamics in our study of continuum thermodynamics. In the special case when the process AB is reversible, \\Delta S_i = 0 and we can write the change in entropy as follows: \\Delta S_{AB} = \\frac{Q_{AB}}{T}. Note the equality in this expression! Using this in conjunction with the first law of thermodynamics and the expression for the work done by the thermodynamic driving forces, we see that \\Delta E_{AB} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_{A}^{B} X_i(S, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n) \\, dY_i + \\frac{Q_{AB}}{T}. This form of the first law is especially useful in deriving a number of equivalent thermodynamic potentials for reversible thermodynamic processes. We will define those potentials as and when we need them later on. Continuum Thermodynamics We will now introduce a thermodynamic approach to modeling continua, and formulate, in particular, the first and second laws of thermodynamics for continua. This will serve as the starting point for our subsequent study of both balance principles and constitutive behavior. Note One of the early drivers for the thermodynamic approach to continuum mechanics is the so-called rational thermodynamics school. The choice of this name is rather unfortunate, in my opinion at least; a much better name would have been axiomatic thermomechanics , but for various reasons the name rational thermodynamics survives. The most vocal proponents of this school of thought were Clifford Truesdell, Bernard Coleman and Walter Noll. One of the defining traits of this school is its axiomatic structure with a fairly large share of postulated laws for a field theoretic approach to the model the mechanical and thermal response of continua. Though a lot of the mathematics we develop in this course will look similar to the approach taken in rational thermodynamics, we will not entirely endorse the Truesdellian approach to modeling continua. There are a few important points to note in order that we can properly understand the development of a thermodynamic theory of continua as a a non-equilibrium field theory . Let us unwrap this in stages: To understand a field theory means, recall that in our review of thermodynamics, the state variables were defined for the whole system . As a simple example, consider the case of a gas in a cylinder with a piston on one end. The volume occupied by the gas is an example of an extensive state variable that is globally defined with respect to the system. Let us now consider an elastic body undergoing deformation as a consequence of external loads acting on it. We will see that the equivalent of the volume of the gas in this case turns out to be the elastic strain. But as should be clear from our study of kinematics, strain is defined pointwise, and is actually a field variable; it is not a global definition as is the case with state variables in conventional thermodynamics. What makes the situation more complicated is that the field variables exhibit both spatial and temporal variations - the strain in an elastic solid can vary over the body, and the entire strain field can evolve over time. This is a defining trait of a system that is out of equilibrium . One of the difficulties in constructing a continuum theory of such non-equilibrium processes is that even in the elementary thermodynamic case, a rigorous theory of systems out of equilibrium with the same generality and depth as equilibrium thermodynamics is not available. In practice, we get away with this problem in continuum mechanics by making a series of assumptions, whose eventual validity is decided solely based on the agreement of the predictions of the resulting theory of continua with experimental data. The most important of this is that it is possible define non-equilibrium field theoretic analogues of quantities like internal energy, entropy, and other state variables that characterize the system. Further, the laws of thermodynamics will be appropriately extended based on these non-equilibrium field variables. The modern theory of dissipative phenomena in continuum mechanics postulates additional field variables called internal variables . These are variables that cannot be controlled, but nevertheless are required to represent the non-equilibrium state of the sytem satisfactorily. We will not delve too much into the thermodynamics of internal variables in this course, primarily because we won't have enough time to cover them in the lectures. A significant issue with this (i.e. the so-called rational ) approach to thermomechanics which postulates the existence of field variables like internal energy and entropy is that there is no longer a clear means to distinguish between thermodynamic equilibrium and the extent of deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium in this framework. Nevertheless, the development to follow can be viewed as a first look at the thermomechanics of continua that provides a working approximation that works well practice. With the foregoing caveats in place, let us now turn to the generalization of the first and second laws of thermodynamics for continua. Suppose that a continuum body \\mathcal{B} occupies a region B_t \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 at the current instant of time. Let us start with the total energy E(t) of the body at the current instant of time t . This can be written as the sum of the internal energy U(t) of the body, and its kinetic energy T(t) , as follows: \\begin{split} E(t) &= T(t) + U(t),\\\\ T(t) &= \\int_{B_t} \\frac{1}{2}\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv,\\\\ U(t) &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. \\end{split} Here, \\rho is the mass density that we studied earlier in the context of kinematics, and \\mathsf{v} is the spatial velocity. The quantity e(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} is the internal energy per unit mass . To understand what this means, consider a small volume \\Delta v centered at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , the internal energy of the material in this volume is given by \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta v . Remark A useful mental picture to understand the meaning of the internal energy \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta v is obtained by picturing the material inside the elementary volume \\Delta v as consisting of a (large!) collection of balls connected by springs, as shown in the figure below: INSERT FIGURE The internal energy of the material in the region \\Delta v can be understood as the sum of the potential energy stored in the springs and the kinetic energy associated with the vibration of the balls about their mean positions. The center-of-mass velocity of this spring-mass system corresponds to the spatial velocity \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) . Note that the internal energy consists of both the potential and kinetic components, though the latter is not the kinetic energy of the macroscopic continuum. This discussion can be made precise using averaging tools from statistial mechanics - this will be discussed in the companion course Multiscale Modeling of Materials . The motion of the body in three dimensional space is viewed as a thermodynamic process. Since this is a continuous-in-time process, we will be working with the rate at which the energy of the body changes, \\dot{E}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\left(e(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)\\,dv, instead of infinitesimal changes in the internal energy as in the case of conventional thermodynamics. We will now extend the first law of thermodynamics for continua as follows: \\dot{E}(t) = P_m(t) + P_h(t), where P_m(t) is mechanical power, and P_h(t) is the rate at which heat is addded to the body. To compute the mechanical power, we need to introduce two distinct kinds of forces that act on a continuum body. The first, called a body force , acts on every volume of material inside the body. The second, called a surface force , acts on the external surface of the body. Example As an example, consider the force of gravity acting on a body in a gravitational field. It is clear that every sub-volume of the body experiences a gravitational force. We thus see that gravity is an example of a body force. As an example of a surface force, suppose that we are holding a block of material in our hands. The block is held in place by the frictional forces between the hand and the block, and acts only on the associated contact surface. To formalize this notion, we introduce a body force density \\mathsf{b}(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 so that the total body force acting on a small volume \\Delta v at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t is given by \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta v . In an analogous fashion, we introduce the surface force density at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t as the vector \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x})) \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , where \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x}) denotes the outward normal to the surface \\partial B_t at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t . This means that the force acting on a small surface area \\Delta a at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t with normal \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) is given by \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\Delta a . Using these definitions, we can write the mechanical power due to the body and surface forces as P_m(t) = \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da. Notice that the body force density is the body force per unit mass , while the surface force density is the surface force per unit area . As the final ingredient to formulating the first law of thermodynamics for continua, write the rate at which heat is added to the body is written as P_h(t) = \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv - \\int_{\\partial B_t} h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da. Here, r(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} is the rate at which heat is produced inside the body, and h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x,t}))\\Delta a is the rate at which heat flows out of B_t into the environment through an infinitesimal area \\Delta a centered at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t .

The primary concern of thermodynamics is a global description of the behavior of a system interacting with an environment , possibly exchanging energy and/or mass in the process. We will formalize these notions below. One of the hallmarks of the thermodynamic description of a phenomena is its generality - it is applicable for any macroscopic phenomena. Trivia There is no better way to summarize the status of thermodynamics among other theories of physics than the introduction provided by Gerard Maugin in his book The thermomechanics of nonlinear irreversible behaviors: An introduction : \" Perhaps, after all, the wise man's attitude towards thermodynamics should be to have nothing to do with it. To deal with thermodynamics is to look for trouble. This is not the citation of a famous scientist, but the result of a deep cogitation following mere observations. Why do we need to get involved in a field of knowledge which, within the last hundred years, has exhibited the largest number of schizophrenics and megalomaniacs, imbalanced scientists, paranoiacs, egocentrists, and probably insomniacs and sleepwalkers? Is there any other field of scientific activity such as this one where, apparently, each of the bricklayers has unhesitatingly revindicated an originality that [...] we may see but with confusion. For some thermodynamicists and for their enemies as well, thermodynamics is the science of everything, so that for the second category of individuals, it is, by mere logic, the science of nothing, and thus not a science at all; and the \"everything\" is naturally seen as a sign of megalomania from which some have not escaped.

The rest of the universe is called the environment . The implicit understanding in this description is that the system is in contact with its environment.

Both these are special kinds of energies; the difference is that work refers a controllable form of energy, while heat refers to the part of the energy that is uncontrollable and often associated with dissipative internal mechanisms in the system. Remark An important assumption that we will make throughout this course is that all interactions are short-ranged This means that there are no long range forces in the system, or in the interactions between the system and its environment. A defining feature of the thermodynamic approach is the study of a complex system as a black box, without any detailed consideration of the microscopic constitution of the system. The system is thus described by means of measurable physical quantities called thermodynamic variables , also known as state variables .

With the foregoing caveats in place, let us now turn to the generalization of the first and second laws of thermodynamics for continua. Suppose that a continuum body \\mathcal{B} occupies a region B_t \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 at the current instant of time. Let us start with the total energy E(t) of the body at the current instant of time t . This can be written as the sum of the internal energy U(t) of the body, and its kinetic energy T(t) , as follows: \\begin{split} E(t) &= T(t) + U(t),\\\\ T(t) &= \\int_{B_t} \\frac{1}{2}\\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv,\\\\ U(t) &= \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv. \\end{split} Here, \\rho is the mass density that we studied earlier in the context of kinematics, and \\mathsf{v} is the spatial velocity. The quantity e(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} is the internal energy per unit mass . To understand what this means, consider a small volume \\Delta v centered at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t , the internal energy of the material in this volume is given by \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta v . Remark A useful mental picture to understand the meaning of the internal energy \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)e(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta v is obtained by picturing the material inside the elementary volume \\Delta v as consisting of a (large!) collection of balls connected by springs, as shown in the figure below: INSERT FIGURE The internal energy of the material in the region \\Delta v can be understood as the sum of the potential energy stored in the springs and the kinetic energy associated with the vibration of the balls about their mean positions. The center-of-mass velocity of this spring-mass system corresponds to the spatial velocity \\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t) . Note that the internal energy consists of both the potential and kinetic components, though the latter is not the kinetic energy of the macroscopic continuum. This discussion can be made precise using averaging tools from statistial mechanics - this will be discussed in the companion course Multiscale Modeling of Materials . The motion of the body in three dimensional space is viewed as a thermodynamic process. Since this is a continuous-in-time process, we will be working with the rate at which the energy of the body changes, \\dot{E}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\left(e(\\mathsf{x},t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\right)\\,dv, instead of infinitesimal changes in the internal energy as in the case of conventional thermodynamics. We will now extend the first law of thermodynamics for continua as follows: \\dot{E}(t) = P_m(t) + P_h(t), where P_m(t) is mechanical power, and P_h(t) is the rate at which heat is addded to the body. To compute the mechanical power, we need to introduce two distinct kinds of forces that act on a continuum body. The first, called a body force , acts on every volume of material inside the body. The second, called a surface force , acts on the external surface of the body. Example As an example, consider the force of gravity acting on a body in a gravitational field. It is clear that every sub-volume of the body experiences a gravitational force. We thus see that gravity is an example of a body force. As an example of a surface force, suppose that we are holding a block of material in our hands. The block is held in place by the frictional forces between the hand and the block, and acts only on the associated contact surface. To formalize this notion, we introduce a body force density \\mathsf{b}(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to T\\mathbb{R}^3 so that the total body force acting on a small volume \\Delta v at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t is given by \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\Delta v . In an analogous fashion, we introduce the surface force density at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t as the vector \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x})) \\in T_{\\mathsf{x}}B_t , where \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x}) denotes the outward normal to the surface \\partial B_t at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t . This means that the force acting on a small surface area \\Delta a at \\mathsf{x} \\in B_t with normal \\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t) is given by \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\Delta a . Using these definitions, we can write the mechanical power due to the body and surface forces as P_m(t) = \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)\\mathsf{b}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv + \\int_{\\partial B_t} \\mathsf{t}(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\cdot\\mathsf{v}(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,da. Notice that the body force density is the body force per unit mass , while the surface force density is the surface force per unit area . As the final ingredient to formulating the first law of thermodynamics for continua, write the rate at which heat is added to the body is written as P_h(t) = \\int_{B_t} \\rho(\\mathsf{x},t)r(\\mathsf{x},t)\\,dv - \\int_{\\partial B_t} h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x},t))\\,da. Here, r(\\cdot,t):B_t \\to \\mathbb{R} is the rate at which heat is produced inside the body, and h(\\mathsf{x},t,\\mathsf{n}(\\mathsf{x,t}))\\Delta a is the rate at which heat flows out of B_t into the environment through an infinitesimal area \\Delta a centered at \\mathsf{x} \\in \\partial B_t .
